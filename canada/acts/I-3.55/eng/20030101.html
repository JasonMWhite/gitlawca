For the purpose of this provision, the term “earnings” means the earnings attributable to the alienation of such immovable property situated in a Contracting State as may be taxed by that State under the provisions of Article 6 or of paragraphs 1 or 4 of Article 13, and the profits, including any gains, attributable to a permanent establishment in a Contracting State in a year or previous years after deducting therefrom all taxes, other than the additional tax referred to herein, imposed on such profits in that State.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 11<br>Interest</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in that State if:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) it is paid to the Government of the other Contracting State or to a political subdivision or local authority thereof or the Central Bank of that State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) it is paid to a resident of Canada in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by the Export Development Corporation; and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) it is paid to a resident of Ecuador in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by an organization which is specified and agreed in letters exchanged between the competent authorities of the Contracting States.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the taxation law of the State in which the income arises.

to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph.</p></li><li><p

company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether

The subcontractor has a permanent establishment only if its activities continue for a period or periods aggregating more than 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the taxable year concerned;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) the 183 day period begins as of the date on which the construction activity itself begins; it does not take into account time spent solely on preparatory activities such as obtaining permits.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. It is understood that, in order for paragraph 4 of Article 5 to apply, the activities listed in subparagraphs 4(<em>a</em>) through (<em>f</em>) and conducted by the resident of a Contracting State must each be of a preparatory or auxiliary character. Therefore, maintaining sales personnel in a Contracting State would not be an activity excepted under paragraph 4 and, subject to paragraphs 1, 5 and 6 of Article 5, would constitute a permanent establishment.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Where an enterprise of a Contracting State sells goods or merchandise or carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, the profits of that permanent establishment shall not be determined on the basis of the total amount received by the enterprise, but shall be determined only on the basis of the income which is attributable to the actual activity of the permanent establishment for such sales or business. In particular, in the case of contracts for the survey, supply, installation or construction of industrial, commercial or scientific equipment or premises, or of public works, when the enterprise has a permanent establishment, the profits of such permanent establishment shall not be determined on the total amount of the contract, but shall be determined only on the basis of that part of the contract which is effectively carried out by the permanent establishment in the State where the permanent establishment is situated. The profits related to that part of the contract which is carried out by the head office of the enterprise shall be taxable only in the State of which the enterprise is a resident.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 7, profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from a voyage of a ship or aircraft where the principal purpose of the voyage is to transport passengers or property between places in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. It is understood that the reference to an “additional tax” in paragraph 6 of Article 10 includes the tax that may be imposed by Venezuela pursuant to the provisions of Article 72 of Presidential Decree No. 307 published on October 22, 1999, in so far as those provisions were in force on, and have not been modified since, the date of signature of the Convention or have been modified only in minor respects so as not to effect their general character.
