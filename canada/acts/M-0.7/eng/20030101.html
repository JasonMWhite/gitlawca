The nullity of such a stipulation does not affect the validity of the other provisions of the contract or document of which it forms a part. A clause assigning benefit of insurance of the goods in favour of the carrier, or any similar clause, is null and void.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article, a carrier may increase his responsibilities and obligations under this Convention.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Where a bill of lading or any other document evidencing the contract of carriage by sea is issued, it must contain a statement that the carriage is subject to the provisions of this Convention which nullify any stipulation derogating therefrom to the detriment of the shipper or the consignee.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Where the claimant in respect of the goods has incurred loss as a result of a stipulation which is null and void by virtue of the present article, or as a result of the omission of the statement referred to in paragraph 3 of this article, the carrier must pay compensation to the extent required in order to give the claimant compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Convention for any loss of or damage to the goods as well as for delay in delivery. The carrier must, in addition, pay compensation for costs incurred by the claimant for the purpose of exercising his right, provided that costs incurred in the action where the foregoing provision is invoked are to be determined in accordance with the law of the State where proceedings are instituted.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 24<br>General average</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Nothing in this Convention shall prevent the application of provisions in the contract of carriage by sea or national law regarding the adjustment of general average.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. With the exception of article 20, the provisions of this Convention relating to the liability of the carrier for loss of or damage to the goods also determine whether the consignee may refuse contribution in general average and the liability of the carrier to indemnify the consignee in respect of any such contribution made or any salvage paid.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 25<br>Other conventions</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. This Convention does not modify the rights or duties of the carrier, the actual carrier and their servants and agents, provided for in international conventions or national law relating to the limitation of liability of owners of seagoing ships.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. The provisions of articles 21 and 22 of this Convention do not prevent the application of the mandatory provisions of any other multilateral convention already in force at the date of this Convention [March 31, 1978] relating to matters dealt with in the said articles, provided that the dispute arises exclusively between parties having their principal place of business in States members of such other convention. However, this paragraph does not affect the application of paragraph 4 of article 22 of this Convention.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. No liability shall arise under the provisions of this Convention for damage caused by a nuclear incident if the operator of a nuclear installation is liable for such damage:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) under either the Paris Convention of 29 July 1960 on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy as amended by the Additional Protocol of 28 January 1964 or the Vienna Convention of 21 May 1963 on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) by virtue of national law governing the liability for such damage, provided that such law is in all respects as favourable to persons who may suffer damage as either the Paris or Vienna Conventions.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. No liability shall arise under the provisions of this Convention for any loss of or damage to or delay in delivery of luggage for which the carrier is responsible under any international convention or national law relating to the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Nothing contained in this Convention prevents a Contracting State from applying any other international convention which is already in force at the date of this Convention and which applies mandatorily to contracts of carriage of goods primarily by a mode of transport other than transport by sea. This provision also applies to any subsequent revision or amendment of such international convention.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 26<br>Unit of account</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The unit of account referred to in article 6 of this Convention is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in article 6 are to be converted into the national currency of a State according to the value of such currency at the date of judgement or the date agreed upon by the parties. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a Contracting State which is a member of the International Monetary Fund is to be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect at the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency in terms of the Special Drawing Right of a Contracting State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund is to be calculated in a manner determined by that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Nevertheless, those States which are not members of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article may, at the time of signature, or at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession or at any time thereafter, declare that the limits of liability provided for in this Convention to be applied in their territories shall be fixed as:</p><p class="indent-1-1">12,500 monetary units per package or other shipping unit or 37.5 monetary units per kilogramme of gross weight of the goods.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The monetary unit referred to in paragraph 2 of this article corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred.

Contracting States must communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article, or the result of the conversion mentioned in paragraph 3 of this article, as the case may be, at the time of signature or when depositing their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or when availing themselves of the option provided for in paragraph 2 of this article and whenever there is a change in the manner of such calculation or in the result of such conversion.</p></li></ul><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">PART VII<br>FINAL CLAUSES</h2><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 27<br>Depositary</h3><p class="indent-1-0">The Secretary General of the United Nations is hereby designated as the depositary of this Convention.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 28<br>Signature, ratification, acceptance, approval, accession</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. This Convention is open for signature by all States until 30 April 1979 at the Headquarters of the United Nations, New York.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. This Convention is subject to ratification, acceptance or approval by the signatory States.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. After 30 April 1979, this Convention will be open for accession by all States which are not signatory States.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval and accession are to be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 29<br>Reservations</h3><p class="indent-1-0">No reservations may be made to this Convention.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 30<br>Entry into force</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. This Convention enters into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of one year from the date of deposit of the 20th instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. For each State which becomes a Contracting State to this Convention after the date of deposit of the 20th instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, this Convention enters into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of one year after the deposit of the appropriate instrument on behalf of that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Each Contracting State shall apply the provisions of this Convention to contracts of carriage by sea concluded on or after the date of the entry into force of this Convention in respect of that State.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 31<br>Denunciation of other conventions</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Upon becoming a Contracting State to this Convention, any State party to the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to Bills of Lading signed at Brussels on 25 August 1924 (1924 Convention) must notify the Government of Belgium as the depositary of the 1924 Convention of its denunciation of the said Convention with a declaration that the denunciation is to take effect as from the date when this Convention enters into force in respect of that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Upon the entry into force of this Convention under paragraph 1 of article 30, the depositary of this Convention must notify the Government of Belgium as the depositary of the 1924 Convention of the date of such entry into force, and of the names of the Contracting States in respect of which the Convention has entered into force.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article apply correspondingly in respect of States parties to the Protocol signed on 23 February 1968 to amend the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to Bills of Lading signed at Brussels on 25 August 1924.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Notwithstanding article 2 of this Convention, for the purposes of paragraph 1 of this article, a Contracting State may, if it deems it desirable, defer the denunciation of the 1924 Convention and of the 1924 Convention as modified by the 1968 Protocol for a maximum period of five years from the entry into force of this Convention.
