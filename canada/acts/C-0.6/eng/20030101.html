Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws or the administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (<em><span class="otherLang" lang="fr">ordre public</span></em>).</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall endeavour to obtain the information to which the request relates in the same way as if its own taxation was involved notwithstanding the fact that the other State does not, at that time, need such information. If specifically requested by the competent authority of a Contracting State, the competent authority of the other Contracting State shall endeavour to provide information under this Article in the form requested, such as depositions of witnesses and copies of unedited original documents (including books, papers, statements, records, accounts or writings), to the same extent such depositions and documents can be obtained under the laws and administrative practices of that other State with respect to its own taxes.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 27<br>Diplomatic Agents and Consular Officers</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic agents or consular officers under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Notwithstanding Article 4, an individual who is a member of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a Contracting State which is situated in the other Contracting State or in a third State shall be deemed for the purposes of the Convention to be a resident of the sending State if he is liable in the sending State to the same obligations in relation to tax on his total income as are residents of that sending State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The Convention shall not apply to international organizations, to organs or officials thereof and to persons who are members of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a third State or a group of States, being present in a Contracting State and who are not liable in either Contracting State to the same obligations in relation to tax on their total income as are residents thereof.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 28<br>Miscellaneous Rules</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The provisions of this Convention shall not be construed to restrict in any manner any exemption, allowance, credit or other deduction accorded:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) by the laws of a Contracting State in the determination of the tax imposed by that State; or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) by any other agreement entered into by a Contracting State.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Nothing in the Convention shall be construed as preventing Canada from imposing a tax on amounts included in the income of a resident of Canada with respect to a partnership, trust, or controlled foreign affiliate, in which he has an interest.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The Convention shall not apply to any company, trust or partnership that is a resident of a Contracting State and is beneficially owned or controlled directly or indirectly by one or more persons who are not residents of that State, if the amount of the tax imposed on the income or capital of the company, trust or partnership by that State is substantially lower than the amount that would be imposed by that State if all of the shares of the capital stock of the company or all of the interests in the trust or partnership, as the case may be, were beneficially owned by one or more individuals who were residents of that State.</p></li></ul><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">VII.
