The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, any option or similar right to acquire immovable property, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property and to income from the alienation of such property.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Where the ownership of shares or other corporate rights in a company entitles the owner of such shares or corporate rights to the enjoyment of immovable property held by the company, the income from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of such right to enjoyment may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the immovable property is situated.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">ARTICLE 7<br>Business Profits</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The business profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on or has carried on business as aforesaid, the business profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the business profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment and with all other persons.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. In the determination of the business profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise (other than expenses which would not be deductible if that permanent establishment were a separate enterprise) which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment including executive and general administrative expenses, whether incurred in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the business profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the business profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this article.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. No business profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the business profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. Where business profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">ARTICLE 8<br>Shipping and Air Transport</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 7, profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from a voyage of a ship where the principal purpose of the voyage is to transport passengers or property between places in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. For the purposes of this Article, profits of an enterprise from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic include</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) profits from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships or aircraft, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) profits from the use, maintenance or rental of containers (including trailers and related equipment for the transport of containers) used for the transport of goods or merchandise,</p><p class="indent-0-0">where such rental or such use, maintenance or rental, as the case may be, is incidental to the operation by an enterprise of ships or aircraft in international traffic.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">ARTICLE 9<br>Associated Persons</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Where</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,</p><p class="indent-0-0">and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State — and taxes accordingly — profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. A Contracting State shall not change the profits of an enterprise in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 after the expiry of the time limits provided in its national laws and, in any case, after five years from the end of the year in which the profits which would be subject to such change would, but for the conditions referred to in paragraph 1, have accrued to that enterprise.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply in the case of fraud, wilful default or neglect.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">ARTICLE 10<br>Dividends</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if a resident of the other Contracting State is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) except in the case of dividends paid by a non-resident-owned investment corporation that is a resident of Canada, 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which controls directly at least 25 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.</p><p class="indent-0-0">The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company on the profits out of which the dividends are paid.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, “jouissance” shares or “jouissance” rights, mining shares, founders’ shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing on the earnings of a company attributable to a permanent establishment in that State, a tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company which is a national of that State, provided that any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 5 per cent of the amount of such earnings which have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years. For the purpose of this provision, the term “earnings” means the profits, including any gains, attributable to a permanent establishment in a Contracting State in a year and previous years after deducting therefrom all taxes, other than the additional tax referred to herein, imposed on such profits in that State.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">ARTICLE 11<br>Interest</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if a resident of the other Contracting State is the beneficial owner of the interest the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2,</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) interest arising in Latvia shall be taxable only in Canada if the interest is paid to</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-2-2">(i) the Government of Canada or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof,</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(ii) the Bank of Canada, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(iii) the Export Development Corporation;</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) interest arising in Canada shall be taxable only in Latvia if the interest is paid to</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-2-2">(i) the Government of Latvia or a local authority thereof,</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(ii) the Bank of Latvia, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(iii) any organization established in Latvia after the date of signature of this Convention and which is of a similar nature as the Export Development Corporation (the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement determine whether such organizations are of a similar nature);</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) interest arising in a Contracting State on a loan guaranteed or insured by any of the bodies mentioned or referred to in subparagraph (<em>a</em>) or (<em>b</em>) and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>d</em>) interest arising in a Contracting State shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-2-2">(i) the recipient is an enterprise of that other State and is the beneficial owner of the interest, and</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(ii) the interest is paid with respect to indebtedness arising on the sale on credit, by that enterprise, of any merchandise or industrial, commercial or scientific equipment to an enterprise of the first-mentioned State, except where the sale or indebtedness is between related persons;</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>e</em>) interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State who is the beneficial owner thereof shall be taxable only in the other State to the extent that such interest is a penalty charge for late payment.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the laws of the Contracting State in which the income arises. However, the term “interest” does not include income dealt with in Article 10.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.

The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, any option or similar right to acquire immovable property, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property and to income from the alienation of such property.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Where the ownership of shares or other corporate rights in a company entitles the owner of such shares or corporate rights to the enjoyment of immovable property held by the company, the income from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of such right to enjoyment may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the immovable property is situated.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">ARTICLE 7<br>Business Profits</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The business profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on or has carried on business as aforesaid, the business profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the business profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment and with all other persons.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. In the determination of the business profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise (other than expenses which would not be deductible if that permanent establishment were a separate enterprise) which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment including executive and general administrative expenses, whether incurred in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the business profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the business profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. No business profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the business profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. Where business profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">8. Nothing in this Article shall prevent a Contracting State from applying its law relating to the taxation of any person who carries on the business of insurance (as long as that law is in effect on the date of signature of this Convention and has not been changed otherwise than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character).</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">ARTICLE 8<br>Shipping and Air Transport</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 7, profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from a voyage of a ship where the principal purpose of the voyage is to transport passengers or property between places in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. For the purposes of this Article, profits of an enterprise from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic include</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) profits from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships or aircraft, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) profits from the use, maintenance or rental of containers (including trailers and related equipment for the transport of containers) used for the transport of goods or merchandise,</p><p class="indent-0-0">where such rental or such use, maintenance or rental, as the case may be, is incidental to the operation by an enterprise of ships or aircraft in international traffic.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">ARTICLE 9<br>Associated Persons</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Where</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,</p><p class="indent-0-0">and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State — and taxes accordingly — profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. A Contracting State shall not change the profits of an enterprise in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 after the expiry of the time limits provided in its national laws and, in any case, after five years from the end of the year in which the profits which would be subject to such change would, but for the conditions referred to in paragraph 1, have accrued to that enterprise.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply in the case of fraud, wilful default or neglect.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">ARTICLE 10<br>Dividends</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if a resident of the other Contracting State is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) except in the case of dividends paid by a non-resident-owned investment corporation that is a resident of Canada, 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which controls directly at least 25 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.</p><p class="indent-0-0">The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company on the profits out of which the dividends are paid.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, “jouissance” shares or “jouissance” rights, mining shares, founders’ shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing on the earnings of a company attributable to a permanent establishment in that State, a tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company which is a national of that State, provided that any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 5 per cent of the amount of such earnings which have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years. For the purpose of this provision, the term “earnings” means the profits, including any gains, attributable to a permanent establishment in a Contracting State in a year and previous years after deducting therefrom all taxes, other than the additional tax referred to herein, imposed on such profits in that State.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">ARTICLE 11<br>Interest</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if a resident of the other Contracting State is the beneficial owner of the interest the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2,</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) interest arising in Estonia shall be taxable only in Canada if the interest is paid to</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-2-2">(i) the Government of Canada or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof,</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(ii) the Bank of Canada, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(iii) the Export Development Corporation;</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) interest arising in Canada shall be taxable only in Estonia if the interest is paid to</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-2-2">(i) the Government of Estonia or a local authority thereof,</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(ii) the Bank of Estonia, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(iii) any organization established in Estonia after the date of signature of this Convention and which is of a similar nature as the Export Development Corporation (the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement determine whether such organizations are of a similar nature);</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) interest arising in a Contracting State on a loan guaranteed or insured by any of the bodies mentioned or referred to in subparagraph (<em>a</em>) or (<em>b</em>) and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>d</em>) interest arising in a Contracting State shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-2-2">(i) the recipient is an enterprise of that other State and is the beneficial owner of the interest, and</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(ii) the interest is paid with respect to indebtedness arising on the sale on credit, by that enterprise, of any merchandise or industrial, commercial or scientific equipment to an enterprise of the first-mentioned State, except where the sale or indebtedness is between related persons;</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>e</em>) interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State who is the beneficial owner thereof shall be taxable only in the other State to the extent that such interest is a penalty charge for late payment.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the laws of the Contracting State in which the income arises.

In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. A Contracting State shall not change the profits of an enterprise in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 after the expiry of the time limits provided in its national laws and, in any case, after six years from the end of the year in which the profits which would be subject to such change would, but for the conditions referred to in paragraph 1, have accrued to that enterprise.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply in the case of fraud, wilful default or neglect.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">ARTICLE 10<br>Dividends</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if a resident of the other Contracting State is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) except in the case of dividends paid by a non-resident-owned investment corporation that is a resident of Canada or by an investment company that is a resident of Trinidad and Tobago, 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.</p><p class="indent-0-0">The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company on the profits out of which the dividends are paid.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, mining shares, founders’ shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income which is, in the case of Canada, subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares under the laws of Canada and, in the case of Trinidad and Tobago, treated as a distribution under the laws of Trinidad and Tobago.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing on the earnings of a company attributable to a permanent establishment in that State, a tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company which is a national of that State, provided that any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 5 per cent of the amount of such earnings which have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">ARTICLE 11<br>Interest</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if a resident of the other Contracting State is the beneficial owner of the interest the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2,</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) interest arising in a Contracting State and paid in respect of indebtedness of the government of that State or of a political subdivision or local authority thereof shall, provided that the interest is beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State, be taxable only in that other State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) interest arising in Trinidad and Tobago and paid to a resident of Canada shall be taxable only in Canada if it is paid in respect of a loan made or a credit extended by the Export Development Corporation;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) interest arising in Canada and paid to a resident of Trinidad and Tobago shall be taxable only in Trinidad and Tobago if it is paid in respect of a loan made or a credit extended by an institution, wholly owned by the government of Trinidad and Tobago, specified and agreed in letters exchanged between the competent authorities of the Contracting States; and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>d</em>) interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State which was constituted and is operated exclusively to administer or provide benefits under one or more pension, retirement or other employee benefits plans shall not be taxable in the first-mentioned State provided that</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-2-2">(i) the resident is the beneficial owner of the interest and is generally exempt from tax in the other State, and</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(ii) the interest is not derived from carrying on a trade or a business or from a related person.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the laws of the State in which the income arises. However, the term “interest” does not include income dealt with in Article 10.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.
