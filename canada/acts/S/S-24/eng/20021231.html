payable under subsection (1) to a recipient whose retirement year is 1982 or a
later year, and who retires, or who is the survivor or a child of a person who
retires, on or after June 22, 1982, for a month in any year following the year
immediately following the retirement year,

    * (_a_) the amount of the pension payable to the recipient for that month referred to in paragraph (1)(_a_) shall be deemed to be the aggregate of the amount of the pension payable to the recipient for that month and the amount of the supplementary retirement benefit for a month in the year immediately following his retirement year calculated pursuant to subsection (3), whether or not that amount was paid; and

    * (_b_) the Benefit Index for the retirement year shall be deemed to be the Benefit Index for the year immediately following his retirement year.

5, the amount of the supplementary retirement benefit that may be paid for a
month in any year to a recipient in respect of whom the retirement year
determined pursuant to subsection (5) is 1976 or a later year shall be not
less than the difference obtained by subtracting the amount of the pension
that may be paid to him for that month in that year from the aggregate of the
supplementary retirement benefit and maximum pension that would have been
payable to that recipient for that month in that year, other than pursuant to
this subsection, if the retirement month of the retirement year of the
recipient had been that month in that year, being a year after 1974, as is
