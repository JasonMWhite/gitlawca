of young persons and to guide them into adulthood;</p><p class="indent-1-0">WHEREAS communities, families, parents and others concerned with the development of young persons should, through multi-disciplinary approaches, take reasonable steps to prevent youth crime by addressing its underlying causes, to respond to the needs of young persons, and to provide guidance and support to those at risk of committing crimes;</p><p class="indent-1-0">WHEREAS information about youth justice, youth crime and the effectiveness of measures taken to address youth crime should be publicly available;</p><p class="indent-1-0">WHEREAS Canada is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and recognizes that young persons have rights and freedoms, including those stated in the <cite class="XRefExternalAct">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite> and the <cite class="XRefExternalAct">Canadian Bill of Rights</cite>, and have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms;</p><p class="indent-1-0">AND WHEREAS Canadian society should have a youth criminal justice system that commands respect, takes into account the interests of victims, fosters responsibility and ensures accountability through meaningful consequences and effective rehabilitation and reintegration, and that reserves its most serious intervention for the most serious crimes and reduces the over-reliance on incarceration for non-violent young persons;</p></section><div class="Enacts"><p class="indent-2-1">NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of
