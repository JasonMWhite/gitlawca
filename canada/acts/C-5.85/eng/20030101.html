The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property and to income from the alienation of such property.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 7<br>Business Profits</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on or has carried on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on or has carried on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on or has carried on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed those deductible expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment including executive and general administrative expenses, whether incurred in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then, the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 8<br>Shipping and Air Transport</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the use or rental of containers (including trailers, barges, and related equipment for the transport of containers) used in international traffic shall be taxable only in that

the voyage is to transport passengers or property between places in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 9<br>Associated Enterprises</h3><p class="indent-1-0">Where</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,</p></li></ul><p class="indent-0-0">and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 10<br>Dividends</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if a resident of the other Contracting State is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company that controls at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.</p></li></ul><p class="indent-0-0">The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The term <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>“dividends”</dfn></span> as used in this Article means:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) dividends on shares including income from shares,

from a “<em>partiarisches Darlehen</em>” (loan, with interest rate linked to borrower’s profit) or “<em>Gewinnobligationen</em>” (profit sharing bonds) and similar remuneration which is dependent on profits as well as distributions on certificates of an investment trust.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State and not also a resident of the other Contracting State derives profits or income from the other State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, Canada may impose on the earnings of a company attributable to permanent establishments in Canada, or on the earnings attributable to the alienation of immovable property situated in Canada by a company carrying on a trade in immovable property, tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company that is a resident of Canada, provided that the rate of such additional tax so imposed shall not exceed the percentage limitation provided for under subparagraph (<em>a</em>) of paragraph 2 of the amount of such earnings which have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years. For the purpose of this provision, the term <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>“earnings”</dfn></span> means:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) the earnings attributable to the alienation of such immovable property situated in Canada as may be taxed by Canada under the provisions of Article 6 or of paragraph 1 of Article 13, and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) the profits attributable to such permanent establishments in Canada (including gains from the alienation of property forming part of the business property, referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 13, of such permanent establishments) in accordance with Article 7 in a year and previous years after deducting therefrom:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-2-2">(aa) business losses attributable to such permanent establishments (including losses from the alienation of property forming part of the business property of such permanent establishments) in such year and previous years,</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(bb) all taxes chargeable in Canada on such profits, other than the additional tax referred to herein,</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(cc) the profits reinvested in Canada, provided that the amount of such deduction shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the law of Canada, as they be amended from time to time without changing the general principle hereof, regarding the computation of the allowance in respect of investment in property in Canada, and</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(dd) five hundred thousand Canadian dollars ($500,000) or its equivalent in the currency of the Federal Republic of Germany, less any amount deducted</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-3-3">(aaa) by the company, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-3-3">(bbb) by a person related thereto from the same or a similar business as that carried on by the company</p></li></ul><p class="indent-2-2">under this clause.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 11<br>Interest</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if a resident of the other Contracting State is the beneficial owner of the interest the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State who is the beneficial owner thereof shall be taxable only in that other State to the extent that such interest:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) is paid in connection with the sale on credit of any equipment or merchandise by the purchasing person to the selling person, except where the sale is made between associated persons;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) is paid in respect of indebtedness of the government of a Contracting State or of a “<em>Land</em>”, or political subdivision or local authority thereof;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) is paid to the Canadian Export Development Corporation or to the German “<em>Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau</em>” or the “<em>Deutsche Gesellschaft für Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit</em>”;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>d</em>) is paid to the government of a Contracting State or of a “<em>Land</em>”, or political subdivision thereof, or to the central bank of a Contracting State; or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>e</em>) is paid to a resident of the other State which was constituted and is operated exclusively to administer or provide benefits under one or more pension, retirement or other employee benefits plans provided that:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-2-2">(aa) the resident is generally exempt from income tax in the other State, and</p></li><li><p class="indent-2-2">(bb) the interest is not derived from carrying on a trade or a business or from an associated person.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p class="indent-0-0">For the purpose of subparagraphs (<em>a</em>) and (<em>e</em>), a person is associated with another person if it is related to, or controlled or managed by the other person or if both persons are related to, or controlled by or managed by a third person. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, a person is related to another person if more than 50 per cent of the voting shares belongs to the other person, to persons with whom the other person is associated, or to other persons so associated with it.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The term <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>“interest”</dfn></span> as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the laws of the State in which the income arises. However, the term <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>“interest”</dfn></span> does not include income dealt with in Article 10.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base.

Such information may be disclosed in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions only if the competent authority of the Contracting State supplying the information raises no objection.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws or the administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (<em><span class="otherLang" lang="fr">ordre public</span></em>).</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall agree upon the principles and procedures relating to the exchange of personal data.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. For the purposes of this Article, the taxes covered by the Agreement are, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, all taxes imposed by a Contracting State.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 27<br>Assistance in Collection</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The Contracting States undertake to lend assistance to each other in the collection of taxes referred to in paragraph 8, together with interest, costs, additions to such taxes and administrative penalties, referred to in this Article as a “revenue claim”. The provisions of this Article are not restricted by Article 1.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. An application for assistance in the collection of a revenue claim shall include a certification by the competent authority of the applicant State that, under the laws of that State, the revenue claim has been finally determined. For the purposes of this Article, a revenue claim is finally determined when the applicant State has the right under its internal law to collect the revenue claim and all administrative and judicial rights of the taxpayer to restrain collection in the applicant State have lapsed or been exhausted.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. A revenue claim of the applicant State that has been finally determined may be accepted for collection by the competent authority of the requested State and, subject to the provisions of paragraph 7, if accepted shall be collected by the requested State as though such revenue claim were the requested State’s own revenue claim finally determined in accordance with the laws applicable to the collection of the requested State’s own taxes.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Where an application for collection of a revenue claim in respect of a taxpayer is accepted:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) by the Federal Republic of Germany, the revenue claim shall be enforced by the Federal Republic of Germany in the same way as a revenue claim under Federal Republic of Germany laws against the taxpayer as of the time the application is received; and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) by Canada, the revenue claim shall be treated by Canada as an amount payable under the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/I-3.3">Income Tax Act</a></cite>, the collection of which is not subject to any restriction.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as creating or providing any rights of administrative or judicial review of the applicant State’s finally determined revenue claim by the requested State, based on any such rights that may be available under the laws of either Contracting State. Proceedings relating to measures taken under this Article by the requested State shall be brought only before the appropriate body of that State. If, at any time pending execution of a request for assistance under this Article, the applicant State loses the right under its internal law to collect the revenue claim, the competent authority of the applicant State shall promptly withdraw the request for assistance in collection.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Unless the competent authorities of the Contracting States otherwise agree, the ordinary costs incurred in providing collection assistance shall be borne by the requested State and any extraordinary costs so incurred shall be borne by the applicant State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. A revenue claim of an applicant State accepted for collection shall not have in the requested State any priority accorded to the revenue claims of the requested State even if the recovery procedure used is the one applicable to its own revenue claims.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">8. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, the provisions of this Article shall apply to all categories of taxes collected by or on behalf of the Government of a Contracting State including, in the case of the Federal Republic of Germany, the “<em>Laender</em>”.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">9. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as imposing on either Contracting State the obligation to carry out administrative measures at variance with its laws or administrative practice or that would be contrary to its fundamental principles of tax policy or its public policy (<em><span class="otherLang" lang="fr">ordre public</span></em>).</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">10. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall agree upon the mode of application of this Article, including agreement to ensure comparable levels of assistance to each of the Contracting States.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 28<br>Members of Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 4, an individual who is a member of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a Contracting State which is situated in the other Contracting State or in a third State shall be deemed for the purposes of the Agreement to be a resident of the sending State if:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) in accordance with international law that individual is not liable to tax in the receiving State in respect of income from sources outside that State or on capital situated outside that State, and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) that individual is liable in the sending State to the same obligations in relation to tax on total income or on capital as are residents of that State.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The Agreement shall not apply to International Organizations, to organs or officials thereof and to persons who are members of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a third State, being present in a Contracting State and not liable in either Contracting State to the same obligations in respect of taxes on income or on capital as are residents thereof.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 29<br>Miscellaneous Rules</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. With respect to income taxable in a Contracting State, the provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed to restrict in any manner any exemption, credit, allowance or other deduction accorded:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) by the laws of a Contracting State in the determination of the tax imposed by that State; or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) by any other agreement entered into by a Contracting State.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. It is understood that nothing in the Agreement shall be construed as preventing:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) Canada from imposing a tax on amounts included in the income of a resident of Canada with respect to a partnership, trust or controlled foreign affiliate, in which that resident has an interest;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) the Federal Republic of Germany from imposing its taxes on amounts included in the income of a resident of the Federal Republic of Germany according to part 4 of the German “<em>Aussensteuergesetz</em>”.</p></li></ul><p class="indent-0-0">Where such imposition of tax gives rise to a double taxation, the competent authorities shall consult for the elimination of such double taxation according to paragraph 3 of Article 25.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The Agreement shall not apply to any company (nor to income derived from such company by a shareholder thereof), trust or partnership that is a resident of a Contracting State and is beneficially owned or controlled directly or indirectly by one or more persons who are not residents of that State, if the amount of the tax imposed on the income or capital of the company, trust or partnership by that State is substantially lower than the amount that would be imposed by that State if all of the shares of the capital stock of the company or all of the interests in the trust or partnership, as the case may be, were beneficially owned by one or more individuals who were residents of that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Contributions in a year in respect of services rendered in that year paid by, or on behalf of, an individual who is a resident of one of the Contracting States or who is temporarily present in that State, to a pension plan that is recognized for tax purposes in the other Contracting State shall, during a period not exceeding in the aggregate 60 months, be treated in the same way for tax purposes in the first-mentioned State as a contribution paid to a pension plan that is recognized for tax purposes in that first-mentioned State, provided that:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) such individual was contributing on a regular basis to the pension plan for a period ending immediately before the individual became a resident of or temporarily present in the first-mentioned State;

Any doubt as to the interpretation of this paragraph shall be resolved under paragraph 3 of Article 25 or, failing agreement under that procedure, pursuant to any other procedure agreed to by both Contracting States.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. Nothing in the Agreement shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from denying benefits under the Agreement where it can reasonably be concluded that to do otherwise would result in an abuse of the provisions of the Agreement or of the domestic laws of that State.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 30<br>Protocol to the Agreement</h3><p class="indent-1-0">The attached Protocol forms an integral part of this Agreement.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 31<br>Entry into Force</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date on which the Contracting States have notified each other that the national requirements for such entry into force have been fulfilled.
