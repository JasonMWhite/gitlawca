included in such Indian reserves as may hereafter be set aside under the last preceding clause as if the said agreement had been made between the parties hereto, and the provisions of the said paragraphs shall likewise apply to the lands included in the reserves heretofore selected and surveyed, except that neither the said lands nor the proceeds of the disposition thereof shall in any circumstances become administrable by or be paid to the Province.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">12. In order to secure to the Indians of the Province the continuance of the supply of game and fish for their support and subsistence, Canada agrees that the laws respecting game in force in the Province from time to time shall apply to the Indians within the boundaries thereof, provided however, that the said Indians shall have the right, which the Province hereby assures to them, of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which the said Indians may have a right of access.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Soldier Settlement Lands</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">13. All interests in Crown lands in the Province upon the security of which any advance has been made under the provisions of the <cite class="XRefExternalAct"><a href="/eng/acts/S-12.8">Soldier Settlement Act</a></cite>, being chapter 188 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, and amending Acts, shall continue to be vested in and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">National Parks</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">14. The parks mentioned in the schedule hereto shall continue as national parks and the lands included therein, as the same are described in the orders in council in the said schedule referred to (except such of the said lands as may be hereafter excluded therefrom), together with the mines and minerals (precious and base) in each of the said parks and the royalties incident thereto, shall continue to be vested in and administered by the Government of Canada as national parks, but in the event of the Parliament of Canada at any time declaring that the said lands or any part thereof are no longer required for park purposes, the lands, mines, minerals (precious and base) and the royalties incident thereto, specified in any such declaration, shall forthwith upon the making thereof belong to the Province, and the provisions of paragraph three of this agreement shall apply thereto as from the date of such declaration.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">15. The Parliament of Canada shall have exclusive legislative jurisdiction within the whole area included within the outer boundaries of each of the said parks notwithstanding that portions of such area may not form part of the park proper; the laws now in force within the said area shall continue in force only until changed by the Parliament of Canada or under its authority, provided, however, that all laws of the Province now or hereafter in force, which are not repugnant to any law or regulation made applicable within the said area by or under the authority of the Parliament of Canada, shall extend to and be enforceable within the same, and that all general taxing acts passed by the Province shall apply within the same unless expressly excluded from application therein by or under the authority of the Parliament of Canada.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">16. The Government of Canada will introduce into the Parliament of Canada such legislation as may be necessary to exclude from the parks aforesaid certain areas forming part of certain of the said parks which have been delimited as including the lands now forming part thereof which are of substantial commercial value, the boundaries of the areas to be so excluded having been heretofore agreed upon by representatives of Canada and of the Province, and the Province agrees that upon the exclusion of the said areas as so agreed upon, it will not, by works outside the boundaries of any of the said parks, reduce the flow of water in any of the rivers or streams within the same to less than that which the Minister of the Interior may deem necessary adequately to preserve the scenic beauties of the said parks.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Seed Grain, Etc., Liens</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">17. Every lien upon any interest in any unpatented land passing to the Province under this agreement, which is now held by Canada as security for an advance made by Canada for seed grain, fodder or other relief, shall continue to be vested in Canada, but the Province will, on behalf of Canada, collect the sums due in respect of such advances, except so far as the same are agreed to be uncollectible, and upon payment of any such advance, any document required to be executed to discharge the lien may be executed by such officer of the Province as may be authorized by any provincial law in that behalf; the Province will account for and pay to Canada all sums belonging to Canada collected hereunder, subject to such deduction to meet the expenses of collection as may be agreed upon between the Minister of the Interior and the Provincial Secretary or such other Minister of the Province as may be designated in that behalf under the laws thereof.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">General Reservation to Canada</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">18. Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, nothing in this agreement shall be interpreted as applying so as to affect or transfer to the

His Majesty the King in the right of His Dominion of Canada is, or is entitled to become the registered owner at the date upon which the agreement comes into force, or <em>(b)</em> any ungranted lands

administration.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Historic Sites, Bird Sanctuaries, Etc.</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">19. The Province will not dispose of any historic site which is notified to it by Canada as such and which Canada undertakes to maintain as an historic site. The Province will further continue and preserve as such the bird sanctuaries and public shooting grounds which have been already established and will set aside such additional bird sanctuaries and public shooting grounds as may hereafter be established by agreement between the Minister of the Interior and the Provincial Secretary or such other Minister of the Province as may be specified under the laws thereof.</p></li></ul><p class="indent-1-0">19a. The Province may discontinue any bird sanctuary or public shooting ground which was transferred to the Province by virtue of this Agreement or which has since been established by the Province or which may hereafter be established by the Province pursuant to this Agreement in any case in which an agreement is entered into between the Minister of Mines and Resources of Canada and the Minister of Lands and Mines of Alberta approved by the Governor in Council and the Lieutenant Governor in Council respectively, providing for the discontinuance of any such bird sanctuary or public shooting ground.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Financial Terms</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">20. In lieu of the provision made by subsection one of section twenty of <cite class="XRefExternalAct">The Alberta Act</cite>, Canada will, from and after the date of the coming into force of this agreement, pay to the Province by half-yearly payments in advance, on the first days of January and July in each year, an annual sum based upon the population of the Province as from time to time ascertained by the quinquennial census thereof, as follows:</p></li></ul><p class="indent-1-0">The sum payable until the population of the said Province reaches eight hundred thousand shall be five hundred and sixty-two thousand five hundred dollars;</p><p class="indent-1-0">Thereafter, until such population reaches one million two hundred thousand, the sum payable shall be seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars;</p><p class="indent-1-0">And thereafter the sum payable shall be one million one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars.</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">21. If at the date of the coming into force of this agreement any payment has been made under subsection one of section twenty of <cite class="XRefExternalAct">The Alberta Act</cite> in respect of any half-year commencing before but terminating after the said date, a proportionate part of the payment so made shall be taken as having been made under the provisions hereof.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">22. It is agreed that the Honourable W.F.A.
