The Bank shall not make any reimbursement for such taxes.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">8. Paragraph 6 of this Article shall not apply to pensions and annuities paid by the Bank.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">9. No tax of any kind shall be levied on any obligation or security issued by the Bank, including any dividend or interest thereon, by whomsoever held:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(i) which discriminates against such obligation or security solely because it is issued by the Bank, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(ii) if the sole jurisdictional basis for such taxation is the place or currency in which it is issued, made payable or paid, or the location of any office or place of business maintained by the Bank.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">10. No tax of any kind shall be levied on any obligation or security guaranteed by the Bank, including any dividend or interest thereon, by whomsoever held:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(i) which discriminates against such obligation or security solely because it is guaranteed by the Bank, or</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(ii) if the sole jurisdictional basis for such taxation is the location of any office or place of business maintained by the Bank.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">ARTICLE 54<br>Implementation of Chapter</h3><p class="indent-1-0">Each member shall promptly take such action as is necessary for the purpose of implementing the provisions of this Chapter and shall inform the Bank of the detailed action which it has taken.</p><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">ARTICLE 55<br>Waiver of Immunities, Privileges and Exemptions</h3><p class="indent-1-0">The immunities, privileges and exemptions conferred under this Chapter are granted in the interest of the Bank. The Board of Directors may waive to such extent and upon such conditions as it may determine any of the immunities, privileges and exemptions conferred under this Chapter in cases where such action would, in its opinion, be appropriate in the best interests of the Bank. The President shall have the right and the duty to waive any immunity, privilege or exemption in respect of any officer, employee or expert of the Bank, other than the President or a Vice-President, where, in his or her opinion, the immunity, privilege or exemption would impede the course of justice and can be waived without prejudice to the interests of the Bank. In similar circumstances and under the same conditions, the Board of Directors shall have the right and the duty to waive any immunity, privilege or exemption in respect of the President and each Vice-President.</p><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">CHAPTER IX<br>AMENDMENTS, INTERPRETATION, ARBITRATION</h2><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">ARTICLE 56<br>Amendments</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Any proposal to amend this Agreement, whether emanating from a member, a Governor or the Board of Directors, shall be communicated to the Chairman of the Board of Governors who shall bring the proposal before that Board.
