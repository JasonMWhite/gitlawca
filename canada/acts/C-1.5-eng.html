enterprise which is a resident of Canada;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) a more-favored tax treatment granted by Brazil after the date of the signature of the present Convention, by virtue of an international Convention, to enterprises, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by residents of countries located in Latin-America shall not constitute, for the purposes of the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article XXIII, a discrimination against a Brazilian enterprise owned or controlled under the same conditions above-mentioned by a
