Methods for Prevention of Double Taxation<br>Elimination of Double Taxation</h4><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. In the case of Canada, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) subject to the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the deduction from tax payable in Canada of tax paid in a territory outside Canada and to any subsequent modification of those provisions — which shall not affect the general principle hereof — and unless a greater deduction of relief is provided under the laws of Canada, tax payable in Luxembourg on profits, income or gains arising in Luxembourg shall be deducted from any Canadian tax payable in respect of such profits, income or gains;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) where, in accordance with any provision of the Convention, income derived or capital owned by a resident of Canada is exempt from tax in Canada, Canada may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on other income or capital, take into account the exempted income or capital.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. In the case of Luxembourg, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) where a resident of Luxembourg derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in Canada, Luxembourg shall, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (<em>b</em>), exempt such income or capital from tax, but may, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of such resident, apply the rate of tax which would have been applicable if the exempted income or capital had not been so exempted;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) where a resident of Luxembourg derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 10, 11, 12, 13 paragraphs 4 and 7, 18 and 21, may be taxed in Canada, Luxembourg shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in Canada. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the income tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income derived from Canada;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) notwithstanding subparagraph (<em>b</em>), dividends distributed by a company resident in Canada, and subject in that State to the corporation tax, to a company resident in Luxembourg which has directly controlled at least 10 per cent of the capital of the first-mentioned company since the beginning of its fiscal year shall be subject to the tax treatment provided for under subparagraph (<em>a</em>).

Special Provisions<br>Non-Discrimination</h4><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to individuals who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. The taxation of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of a third State, are or may be subjected.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. In this Article, the term <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>“taxation”</dfn></span> means taxes which are the subject of this Convention.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 25<br>Mutual Agreement Procedure</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, address to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which that person is a resident or, if that person’s case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 24, to that of the Contracting State of which that person is a national, an application in writing stating the grounds for claiming the revision of such taxation. To be admissible, the said application must be submitted within two years from the first notification of the action which gives rise to taxation not in accordance with the Convention.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. The competent authority referred to in paragraph 1 shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with the Convention.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. In particular, the competent authorities of the Contracting States may consult together to endeavour to agree:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) to the same attribution of profits to an enterprise of a Contracting State and to its permanent establishment situated in the other Contracting State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) to the same allocation of profits between associated enterprises as provided for in Article 9;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) to the method of avoiding double taxation in the case of an estate or trust.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of applying the provisions of the Convention.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 26<br>Exchange of Information</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by the Convention insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1. Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by the Convention. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws or the administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall endeavour to obtain the information to which the request relates in the same way as if its own taxation were involved even though the other State does not, at that time, need such information. If specifically requested by the competent authority of a Contracting State, the competent authority of the other Contracting State shall endeavour to provide information under this Article in the form requested, such as depositions of witnesses and copies of unedited original documents (including books, papers, statements, records, accounts or writings), to the same extent such information can be obtained under the laws and administrative practices of that other State with respect to its own taxes.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 27<br>Members of Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Notwithstanding Article 4, an individual who is a member of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a Contracting State which is situated in the other Contracting State or in a third State shall be deemed for the purposes of the Convention to be a resident of the sending State if that individual is liable in the sending State to the same obligations in relation to tax on total income as are residents of that sending State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The Convention shall not apply to International Organizations, to organs or officials thereof and to persons who are members of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a third State or group of States, being present in a Contracting State and who are not liable in either Contracting State to the same obligations in relation to tax on their total income as are residents thereof.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 28<br>Miscellaneous Rules</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The provisions of this Convention shall not be construed to restrict in any manner any exemption, allowance, credit or other deduction now or hereafter accorded by the laws of a Contracting State in the determination of the tax imposed by that State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Nothing in the Convention shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing a tax on amounts included in the income of a resident of that State with respect to a partnership, trust, or controlled foreign affiliate, in which that resident has an interest.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The Convention shall not apply to holding companies within the meaning of the special Luxembourg laws (currently the Act of July 31, 1929 and the Grand Duchy Order of December 17, 1938) or any other similar law enacted in Luxembourg after the signature of the Convention, nor to companies subjected to similar fiscal laws in Luxembourg. It shall not apply either to income derived by a resident of Canada from such holding companies nor to shares or other rights in the capital of such companies owned by such person.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. For the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article XXII (Consultation) of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the Contracting States agree that, notwithstanding that paragraph, any dispute between them as to whether a measure falls within the scope of this Convention may be brought before the Council for Trade in Services, as provided by that paragraph, only with the consent of both Contracting States. Any doubt as to the interpretation of this paragraph shall be resolved under paragraph 3 of Article 25 or, failing agreement under that procedure, pursuant to any other procedure agreed to by both Contracting States.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 29<br></h3><h4 class="SchedHeadL3">VII. Final Provisions<br>Entry into Force</h4><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. This Convention shall be ratified and the instruments of ratification shall be exchanged as soon as possible.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. The Convention shall enter into force upon the exchange of instruments of ratification and its provisions shall have effect:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) in respect of tax withheld at the source on amounts paid or credited to non-residents on or after the first day of January in the calendar year next following that in which the exchange of instruments of ratification takes place; and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) in respect of other taxes for taxation years beginning on or after the first day of January in the calendar year next following that in which the exchange of instruments of ratification takes place.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The provisions of the Convention between Canada and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital signed at Luxembourg on the 17th day of January, 1989, shall cease to have effect with respect to taxes to which this Convention applies in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 30<br>Termination</h3><p class="indent-1-0">This Convention shall continue in effect indefinitely but either Contracting State may, on or before June 30 in any calendar year after the year of the exchange of instruments of ratification, give to the other Contracting State a notice of termination in writing through diplomatic channels.
