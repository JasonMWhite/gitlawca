investment in health and the health care system is part of the Canadian vision of being a caring society;</p><p class="indent-1-0">WHEREAS Parliament recognizes that the provinces are responsible for the delivery of health care to Canadians and that the Government of Canada collaborates with provincial governments to support the health care system and health research;</p><p class="indent-1-0">WHEREAS Parliament believes that health research should</p><p class="indent-1-1">address the respective health issues of children, women and men and of the diverse populations of Canada,</p><p class="indent-1-1">be characterized by a transparent approach that facilitates accountability to Canadians, and</p><p class="indent-1-1">take into consideration ethical issues;</p><p class="indent-1-0">WHEREAS Parliament is cognizant of an historic opportunity to transform health research in Canada through the creation of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research as a flexible mechanism that will continually align health research funding with changes in the manner in which health problems and opportunities are identified, understood and addressed;</p><p class="indent-1-0">WHEREAS Parliament believes that health research institutes should be created to coordinate, focus and integrate health research based on</p><p class="indent-1-1">an understanding of the multi-factorial nature of health problems and opportunities,</p><p class="indent-1-1">the involvement and recognition of, and respect for, health researchers from all research disciplines, and the cooperation of a wide range of partners from all relevant sectors, the provinces and other countries,</p><p class="indent-1-1">the attraction of the best health researchers in Canada and the world

and</p><p class="indent-1-1">the application of that knowledge to the development and implementation of innovative policy and practice;</p><p class="indent-1-0">WHEREAS Parliament understands that this transformation in health research can build on the legacy of excellence in health research already established in Canada, including the decisive contributions of the Medical Research Council and the National Health Research and Development Program, while understanding that the institutions, technologies and environment for health research have become more varied and complex than in the past;</p><p class="indent-1-0">WHEREAS Parliament recognizes that this transformation in Canadian health research will also enhance economic development in Canada and promote growth and job creation in key sectors of the knowledge-based economy;</p><p class="indent-1-0">AND WHEREAS Parliament believes that the Canadian Institutes of Health Research will provide the leadership required for this
