Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:</p><p class="indent-1-1"><em>a</em>) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;</p><p class="indent-1-1"><em>b</em>) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;</p><p class="indent-1-1"><em>c</em>) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (<em>ordre public</em>).</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall endeavour to obtain the information to which the request relates in the same way as if its own taxation was involved notwithstanding the fact that the other State does not, at that time, need such information. If specifically requested by the competent authority of a Contracting State, the competent authority of the other Contracting State shall endeavour to provide information under this Article in the form requested, such as depositions of witnesses and copies of unedited original documents (including books, papers, statements, records, accounts or writings), to the same extent such depositions and documents can be obtained under the laws and administrative practices of that other State with respect to its own taxes.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 28<br><em>Assistance in Collection</em></h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The Contracting States undertake to lend assistance to each other in the collection of taxes referred to in paragraph 8, together with interest, costs, additions to such taxes and civil penalties, referred to in this Article as a “revenue claim”.
