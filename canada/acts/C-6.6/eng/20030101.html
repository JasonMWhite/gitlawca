However, when the activities of such a person are devoted wholly or almost wholly on behalf of that enterprise, that person shall not be considered an agent of an independent status within the meaning of this paragraph.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">9. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other Contracting State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.</p></li></ul><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">ARTICLE 6<br>Income from Immovable Property</h2><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. The term <span class="DefinedTerm"><dfn>“immovable property”</dfn></span> shall have the meaning, which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated.

Likewise, no account shall be taken, in the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, for amounts charged (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses), by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission for specific services performed or for management, or, except in the case of a banking enterprise, by way of interest on moneys lent to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">6. If the information available to the competent authority of a Contracting State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment of an enterprise, nothing in paragraph 2 shall affect the application of any law or regulations of that Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of the enterprise in relation to that permanent establishment by the making of an estimate by the competent authority of that Contracting State of the profits to be attributed to that permanent establishment, provided that such law or regulations shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, in accordance with the principles of this Article.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">7. For the purpose of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">8. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.</p></li></ul><h2 class="SchedHeadL1">ARTICLE 8<br>International Traffic</h2><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that Contracting State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. For the purposes of this Article, profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic include:</p><p class="indent-1-1"><em>a</em>) profits from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships and aircraft;
