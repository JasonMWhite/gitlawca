In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply after the expiry of the time limits provided in the national laws of the State requested to make the adjustment.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 10<br>Dividends</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:</p><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>a</em>) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company that controls directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power, or that holds directly at least 25 per cent of the capital, in the company paying the dividends;</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>b</em>) notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (<em>a</em>), 10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the dividends are paid by a non-resident owned investment corporation that is a resident of Canada to a beneficial owner that is a resident of Sweden and that controls directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power, or that holds directly at least 25 per cent of the capital, of the corporation paying the dividends; and</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-1">(<em>c</em>) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.</p><p class="indent-0-0">The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, mining shares, founders’ shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base.

The provisions of the Convention relating to immovable property shall apply also to property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, any option or similar right to acquire immovable property, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources, to the extent that such rights or property are not included in the definition of the term “immovable property” in the preceding sentence. Ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property and to income from the alienation of such property.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Where the ownership of shares or other corporate rights in a company entitles the owner of such shares or corporate rights to the enjoyment of immovable property held by the company, the income from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of such right to enjoyment may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the immovable property is situated.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services.</p></li></ul><h3 class="SchedHeadL2">Article 7<br>Business Profits</h3><ul class="ProvisionList"><li><p class="indent-1-0">1. The business profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on or has carried on business as aforesaid, the business profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the business profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment and with all other persons.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">3. In the determination of the business profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses (other than expenses which would not be deductible if that permanent establishment were a separate enterprise) which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment including executive and general administrative expenses, whether incurred in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.</p></li><li><p class="indent-1-0">4. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the business profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the business profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary;
