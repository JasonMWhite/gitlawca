  * (_c_) where the recipient is domiciled in Canada and ordinarily resident in a province in which there is in force a law of general application permitting garnishment, attachment or diversion of pensions for the enforcement of financial support orders, the amount to be diverted shall be determined in accordance with the law of that province in force at the time of the diversion payment,

  * (_e_) where the recipient is domiciled outside Canada and the applicant is ordinarily resident in a province described in paragraph (_c_), the amount to be diverted shall be determined in accordance with the law of that province in force at the time of the diversion payment,

  * (_f_) where the recipient is domiciled outside Canada and the applicant is ordinarily resident in a province other than one described in paragraph (_c_), the amount to be diverted shall be the amount required to satisfy the financial support order, up to a maximum of fifty per cent of the recipient’s net pension benefit, or

  * R.S., 1985, c. G-2, s. 36;
  * 1997, c. 1, s. 34.

###### Lump sum financial support order vs. periodic pension benefit

**37.** (1) Where a financial support order provides only for a lump sum payment and the recipient’s pension benefit consists only of periodic payments, no diversion shall be made, except as provided in subsection (2).

###### Circumstances in which diversion shall be made

(2) Where the Minister is of the opinion that it is impossible or impracticable for a financial support order described in subsection (1) to be varied to stipulate periodic payments and the Minister has so notified the applicant and the recipient, a diversion shall be made in the amount of fifty per cent of the recipient’s monthly net pension benefit, subject to subsection (3), until

  * (_a_) the financial support order has been satisfied in full by the diversion; or

  * (_b_) the Minister is satisfied, on receipt of evidence submitted by the applicant or recipient, that the financial support order has been satisfied in full by other means or is no longer valid and subsisting.

###### Filing of annual statement

(3) Where a diversion described in subsection (2) is made, the applicant must file annually with the Minister, within the prescribed time, a written statement respecting the applicant’s continued entitlement to the diversion, containing the prescribed information, signed by the applicant and witnessed by a person of a prescribed category.

###### Financial support order providing for lump sum and periodic payments vs. periodic pension benefit

**38.** Where a financial support order provides for a lump sum payment and for periodic payments and the recipient’s pension benefit consists only of periodic payments, the two components of the financial support order shall be treated as follows:

  * (_a_) the periodic component of the financial support order shall be dealt with in accordance with the rules in paragraphs 36(_c_) to (_g_); and

  * (_b_) where

    * (i) the amount diverted pursuant to paragraph (_a_) is less than fifty per cent of the recipient’s net pension benefit, and

    * (ii) the maximum that could be diverted pursuant to paragraph (_a_) as a result of the application of the rules in paragraphs 36(_c_) to (_g_) exceeds the amount actually diverted pursuant to paragraph (_a_),

then, in respect of the excess referred to in subparagraph (ii), section 37 applies, with such modifications as the circumstances require, to the lump sum component of the financial support order, but the application of that section may not raise the total diversion under this Part to more than fifty per cent of the recipient’s net pension benefit.

  * R.S., 1985, c. G-2, s. 38;
  * 1997, c. 1, s. 35.

  * (_a_) take all reasonable steps to cause payment to the recipient of any portion of the recipient’s pension benefit that could be subject to diversion as a result of the application of the rules in paragraphs 36(_c_) to (_g_) to be delayed, in accordance with this section; and

  * (_b_) cause the applicant to be notified by registered mail that, unless the financial support order is varied in accordance with this section, it will be treated as a financial support order for a lump sum payment of an amount equal to one periodic payment under the original financial support order.

###### Applicant must seek variation of financial support order

(2) Where, within thirty days of receipt by the applicant of the notification referred to in paragraph (1)(_b_), the Minister is satisfied, on receipt of evidence submitted by the applicant, that the applicant has applied to court for variation of the financial support order to one providing in whole or in part for a lump sum payment, the Minister shall cause payment of the pension benefit to the recipient to be further delayed for a further period not exceeding ninety days.

###### When notification deemed to be received by applicant

(3) For purposes of subsection (2), the date set out in an acknowledgment of receipt issued in accordance with regulations relating to registered mail made under the [Canada Post Corporation Act](/canada/eng/acts/C/C-10.md) shall be deemed to be the date of receipt by the applicant of the notification to which that acknowledgment of receipt relates.

###### Where condition not satisfied

(4) Where the evidence referred to in subsection (2) is not received by the Minister within the period mentioned in that subsection, the Minister shall forthwith treat the application for diversion as an application based on a financial support order for the payment of a lump sum equal to the amount of one periodic payment under the original financial support order.

###### Applicant must submit varied financial support order to Minister

(5) Where, within ninety days after receiving the evidence referred to in subsection (2), the Minister receives a certified copy of a varied financial support order providing in whole or in part for a lump sum payment, the Minister shall proceed with the application for diversion in accordance with this Part.

  * R.S., 1985, c. G-2, s. 39;
  * 1997, c. 1, s. 36.

###### Financial support order for lump sum and periodic payments vs. lump sum pension benefit

**40.** Where a financial support order provides for a lump sum payment and periodic payments and the recipient’s pension benefit consists only of a lump sum, the two components of the financial support order shall be treated as follows:

  * (_a_) the lump sum component of the financial support order shall be dealt with in accordance with the rules in paragraphs 36(_c_) to (_g_); and

  * (_b_) where the maximum that could be diverted pursuant to paragraph (_a_) as a result of the application of the rules in paragraphs 36(_c_) to (_g_) exceeds the amount actually diverted pursuant to paragraph (_a_), then, in respect of that excess, section 39 applies, with such modifications as the circumstances require, to the periodic component of the financial support order.

  * R.S., 1985, c. G-2, s. 40;
  * 1997, c. 1, s. 37.

###### Arrears of payment of support

**40.1** Notwithstanding paragraph 36(_d_), (_f_) or (_g_), subsection 37(2) or section 38, 39 or 40, where the financial support order is an order or judgment for arrears of payments, the amount to be diverted may exceed fifty per cent of the recipient’s net pension benefit.
