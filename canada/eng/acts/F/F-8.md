  * (_a_) the amount determined by the formula

(A + B) × C

where

A 
    is the aggregate of the amounts obtained by subtracting, for each revenue source except the one referred to in paragraph (_e_) of the definition “revenue source” in subsection 3.5(1), the average annual per capita yield in that province for the revenue source for that fiscal year from the average annual per capita national yield for the revenue source for that fiscal year,
B 
    is 50% of the amount obtained by subtracting, for the revenue source referred to in paragraph (_e_) of the definition “revenue source” in subsection 3.5(1), the average annual per capita revenue to be equalized for that province for that fiscal year from the average annual per capita national revenue to be equalized for that fiscal year, and
C

where

A and C

**3.3** [Repealed, 2013, c. 33, s. 113]

###### Less than 50% of population

**3.4** (1) If the aggregate of the average annual population of all provinces for a fiscal year to which a fiscal equalization payment would be paid for that fiscal year, if the amount of that payment were determined under paragraph 3.2(1)(_a_), is less than 50% of the aggregate of the average annual population of all provinces for that fiscal year and if the amount that may be paid to a province for that fiscal year under section 3.2 would, if paid, result in that province having, in that fiscal year, a total per capita fiscal capacity that is greater than the per capita equalized fiscal capacity of any province that would not receive a fiscal equalization payment for that fiscal year if the amount of that payment were determined under paragraph 3.2(1)(_a_), the fiscal equalization payment that may be paid to that province for that fiscal year determined under section 3.2 shall be reduced by the amount determined by the formula

B 
    is the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate of the equalized fiscal capacity of all provinces to which a fiscal equalization payment would be paid for that fiscal year, if the amount of that payment were determined under paragraph 3.2(1)(_a_), by the aggregate of the average annual population of all of those provinces for that fiscal year, and
C 
    is the average annual population of that province for that fiscal year.

###### Re-calculation

(3) If, as a result of the application of subsection (2), the amount of the fiscal equalization payment that may be paid to any province for a fiscal year is reduced to zero, that subsection applies again, but the description of B in that subsection does not include, for that fiscal year, the equalized fiscal capacity and the average annual population of any province to which the amount of the fiscal equalization payment is reduced to zero.

###### Multiple applications

(4) For greater certainty, subsection (3) applies after each application of subsection (2).

B 
    is the average of the annual rates of growth of the nominal gross domestic product of Canada, as determined by the Minister, for the calendar year that ends during the fiscal year in question and for the two previous calendar years.

###### Calculation

(6) If the aggregate of the fiscal equalization payments that would be paid for a fiscal year, if the amounts of those payments were determined under subsections (1) to (4) and section 3.2 as if no province had made an election under subsection 3.2(2), exceeds the amount determined under subsection (5), the fiscal equalization payment that may be paid to a province for that fiscal year determined under subsections (1) to (4) and section 3.2 shall be reduced by the amount determined by the formula

A × B

where

A 
    is the lesser of the per capita equalization payment for that province for that fiscal year and the per capita reduction; and
B 
    is the average annual population of that province for that fiscal year.

###### Per capita calculation

(7) For the purposes of subsection (6), the Minister shall determine the per capita reduction for a fiscal year and shall, in making that determination, ensure that the aggregate of the reductions referred to in that subsection is equal to the amount determined by the formula

A – B

where

A 
    is the aggregate of the fiscal equalization payments that would be paid for that fiscal year, if the amounts of those payments were determined under subsections (1) to (4) and section 3.2 as if no province had made an election under subsection 3.2(2); and

(8) If the aggregate of the fiscal equalization payments that would be paid for a fiscal year, if the amounts of those payments were determined under subsections (1) to (4) and section 3.2 as if no province had made an election under subsection 3.2(2), is less than the amount determined under subsection (5), there may be paid to a province for that fiscal year an adjustment payment that is,

  * (_a_) in the case of a province to which a fiscal equalization payment would be paid for that fiscal year, if the amount of that payment were determined under subsections (1) to (4) and section 3.2, the amount determined by the formula

A × B

where

A 
    is the per capita adjustment for that fiscal year, and
B 
    is the average annual population of that province for that fiscal year; and

  * (_b_) in any other case, the greater of zero and the amount determined by the formula

(C + D – E) × F

where

A – B

where

A 
    is the amount determined under subsection (5); and

###### Incentive to eliminate capital taxes

**10.** (1) As an incentive for a province to eliminate capital taxes imposed by the province, the province is eligible to receive a payment under this Part if

  * (_a_) before January 2, 2011, it eliminates a capital tax that is imposed under a law of the province that was in force on March 18, 2007; and

  * (_b_) any legislation that is required to give effect to the elimination is enacted after March 18, 2007 and before January 2, 2011.

###### Meaning of elimination

(2) For the purposes of this Part, a capital tax is considered to be eliminated if

  * (_a_) under the law of the province, the tax ceases before January 2, 2011 to be imposed on all corporations, except that the tax may continue to be imposed on any corporation that is exempt from tax under any of paragraphs 149(1)(_d_) to (_d.4_) of the [Income Tax Act](/canada/eng/acts/I/I-3.3.md) on all of its taxable income; or

  * (_b_) in the case where the tax is imposed only on financial institutions, the law under which the tax is imposed is amended, before January 2, 2011, to replace the tax with a new capital tax imposed only on financial institutions that meets the following criteria:

    * (i) no financial institution becomes subject to the new capital tax that was not subject to the replaced tax,

    * (ii) every financial institution on which the new capital tax is imposed must be permitted to reduce the amount of the new capital tax payable by it for a taxation year by the amount of income tax payable by it to the province for the year and, if the amount of income tax so payable exceeds the amount of the new capital tax so payable, the financial institution must be permitted to apply the amount of the excess to reduce capital tax payable by it in other taxation years in a manner satisfactory to the Minister, and

    * (iii) the Minister is satisfied that the total amount of revenue that would be raised by the new capital tax from financial institutions if there were no reduction for income tax payable is intended to be broadly commensurate with the total amount of revenue raised from those financial institutions by the province’s income tax.

###### Separate capital tax

(3) If a province imposes a capital tax that applies to financial institutions as well as corporations that are not financial institutions, the capital tax is deemed to be two separate capital taxes for the purposes of this Part.
