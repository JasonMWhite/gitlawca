###### Offences by employees or agents

**12.** In a prosecution for an offence under this Act, it is sufficient proof of the offence to establish that it was committed by an employee or agent of the accused, whether or not the employee or agent is identified or has been prosecuted for the offence, unless the accused establishes that the offence was committed without the knowledge or consent of the accused and that the accused exercised all due diligence to prevent its commission.

###### Additional fine

###### Appearance of accused at trial

(3) For greater certainty, in a proceeding commenced in any territorial division under subsection (2), the provisions of the [Criminal Code](/canada/eng/acts/C/C-46.md) relating to requirements that an accused appear at and be present during proceedings and any exceptions to those requirements apply.

###### Limitation period

When so filed, the conviction is entered as a judgment for a debt in the amount of the fine and costs, if any, and is enforceable against the person in the same manner as if it were a judgment obtained by Her Majesty in right of Canada against the person in that court in civil proceedings.

## EVIDENCE

###### Certificates and reports

**18.** (1) In a proceeding under this Act, a report of an investigator appearing to have been signed by the investigator or a certificate, as the case may be, is admissible in evidence without proof of the signature or official character of the person appearing to have signed it and is evidence of the matters asserted in it.

###### Copies or extracts

(2) In a proceeding under this Act, a copy of or an extract from any book, record, electronic data or document, made by an investigator under this Act and appearing to have been certified under the investigator’s signature as a true copy or extract, is admissible in evidence without proof of the signature or official character of the person appearing to have signed the copy or extract and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, has the same probative force as the original would have if it were proved in the ordinary way.

###### Presumption of advertising services for Canadian advertiser

**19.** In a prosecution against a foreign publisher for an offence under section 3, proof that advertising content bears the name, trade-name or trade-mark of a Canadian advertiser or an address or a telephone number that appears to be that of a Canadian advertiser is proof, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that advertising services were supplied by the foreign publisher to the Canadian advertiser or to a person acting on their behalf.
