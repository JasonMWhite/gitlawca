###### Amount of tax — bringing of property onto lands

(8) For the purposes of subsection (1), the amount of tax that may be imposed under the law of a first nation in respect of the bringing of property onto the lands of the first nation by a person is equal to the amount determined by the formula

    is the rate of tax set out in subsection 165(1) of the [Excise Tax Act](/canada/eng/acts/E/E-15.md), and
B 
    is

  * (_a_) if the person last acquired the property by way of a sale under which the property was delivered to the person within thirty days before the day on which it is brought onto the lands of the first nation, the value of the consideration on which tax under Part IX of the [Excise Tax Act](/canada/eng/acts/E/E-15.md) in respect of the sale would have been calculated but for the application of the exemption under section 87 of the [Indian Act](/canada/eng/acts/I/I-5.md) or of any other exemption from taxation under any other Act of Parliament that is similar to the exemption under that section, and

  * (_b_) in any other case, the lesser of

  * (_a_) if the person is a registrant who acquired the property for consumption, use or supply primarily in the course of commercial activities of the person, the person shall, on or before the day on or before which the person’s return in respect of net tax is required to be filed under the law of the first nation for the reporting period in which the tax became payable, pay the tax to the Receiver General and report the tax in that return; and

  * (_b_) in any other case, the person shall, on or before the last day of the month following the calendar month in which the tax became payable, pay the tax to the Receiver General and file with the Minister of National Revenue in the manner authorized by that Minister a return in respect of the tax in the form authorized by and containing information specified by that Minister.

###### Amount of tax — supply made on lands

(10) For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(_a_) and (_c_), the amount of tax that may be imposed under the law of a first nation in respect of a supply is equal to the amount of tax that would be imposed under Part IX of the [Excise Tax Act](/canada/eng/acts/E/E-15.md) in respect of that supply if

  * (_a_) the [Excise Tax Act](/canada/eng/acts/E/E-15.md) applied and the law of the first nation, the exemption under section 87 of the [Indian Act](/canada/eng/acts/I/I-5.md) and any other exemption from taxation under any other Act of Parliament that is similar to the exemption under that section did not apply in respect of that supply;

###### Administration and enforcement

(11) A law enacted under subsection (1) by the governing body of a first nation shall be administered and enforced, and the tax imposed under that law shall be collected, in accordance with an administration agreement entered into under subsection 11(2) by the authorized body of the first nation.

  * 2003, c. 15, s. 67 “4”;
  * 2005, c. 19, s. 6.

###### Tax attributable to a first nation

**5.** (1) An administration agreement in respect of a first nation law, as defined in subsection 11(1) or 12(1), of a particular first nation shall provide for payments by the Government of Canada to the particular first nation in respect of that law based on an estimate for each calendar year of the total (in this section referred to as “tax attributable to the first nation”) of

  * (_a_) the amount by which

    * (i) the total of all amounts each of which is an amount of tax (other than tax payable by a listed financial institution) that, while that first nation law was in force, became payable in the year under a first nation law, as defined in subsection 11(1) or 12(1), or Part IX of the [Excise Tax Act](/canada/eng/acts/E/E-15.md) (other than subsections 165(2), 212.1(2) and 218.1(1) and Division IV.1) and that is attributable to property or a service that is for consumption or use on the lands of the particular first nation

      * (C) is an amount of tax in respect of a supply to a person who is, under any Act of Parliament or any other law, exempt from paying the tax, and

  * (_b_) the total of all amounts each of which is determined in respect of a listed financial institution by the formula

A × B

where

A 
    is the excess that would be determined under paragraph (_a_) in respect of the financial institution if subparagraph (_a_)(i) were read without reference to the words “that is for consumption or use on the lands of the particular first nation” and that subparagraph included amounts of tax payable by the financial institution but did not include amounts of tax payable by any other person, and
B 
    is the percentage that would be determined, for the purpose of the description of C in the formula in subsection 225.2(2) of the [Excise Tax Act](/canada/eng/acts/E/E-15.md), as the financial institution’s percentage for the particular first nation for the last taxation year of the financial institution ending in that calendar year (or, if the financial institution does not have a taxation year ending in that calendar year, for the period that would be that last taxation year if the taxation year of the financial institution that is partly included in that calendar year ended at the end of that calendar year) if the financial institution were a selected listed financial institution and the lands of the particular first nation were a participating province.
