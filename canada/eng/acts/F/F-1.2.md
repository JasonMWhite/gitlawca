# Family Homes on Reserves and Matrimonial Interests or Rights Act

S.C. 2013, c. 20

Assented to 2013-06-19

An Act respecting family homes situated on First Nation reserves and matrimonial interests or rights in or to structures and lands situated on those reserves

###### Preamble

Whereas it is necessary to address certain family law matters on First Nation reserves since provincial and territorial laws that address those matters are not applicable there and since the Indian Act does not address those matters;

Whereas measures are required to provide spouses or common-law partners with rights and remedies during a conjugal relationship, when that relationship breaks down or on the death of a spouse or common-law partner in respect of

the use, occupation and possession of family homes on reserves, including exclusive occupation of those homes in cases of family violence, and

the division of the value of any interests or rights that they hold in or to structures and lands on those reserves;

Whereas it is important that, when spouses or common-law partners exercise those rights and seek those remedies, the decision-maker

take into account the best interests of the children, including the interest of any child who is a First Nation member to maintain a connection with that First Nation, and

be informed by the First Nation with respect to the cultural, social and legal context in the circumstances;

Whereas the Government of Canada has recognized the inherent right of self-government as an aboriginal right and is of the view that implementation of that right is best achieved through negotiations;

Whereas this Act is not intended to define the nature and scope of any right of self-government or to prejudge the outcome of any self-government negotiation;

And whereas the Parliament of Canada wishes to advance the exercise, in a manner consistent with the Constitution Act, 1982, of First Nations law-making power over family homes on reserves and matrimonial interests or rights in or to structures and lands on reserves;

Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
