## Warranty

###### Disclosure is not warranty

**19.** A disclosure relating to energy efficiency that is required to be made by a dealer under this Act in respect of tests conducted under this Act does not create an express or implied warranty by anyone, including Her Majesty in right of Canada, that the energy efficiency established by those tests will be achieved under conditions of actual use.

## Regulations
