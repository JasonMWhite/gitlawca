(2) Where, at any time before or after a notice of confirmation has been registered, the Governor in Council is of the opinion that the physical possession or use by the Crown of the land to which the notice relates to the extent of the interest expropriated or intended to be expropriated is, by reason of special circumstances, urgently required, the Governor in Council may direct

  * (_a_) that there be substituted for the ninety days referred to in paragraph (1)(_c_) such lesser number of days as in his opinion the circumstances require; or

  * (_b_) where an application has been made under section 18 but has not been finally disposed of, that physical possession or use may be taken or made by the Crown notwithstanding that no offer has then been made under section 16.

  * R.S., c. 16(1st Supp.), s. 17.

###### Intention to abandon expropriation: right of election to accept or reject abandonment

**20.** (1) Where, at any time before any compensation is paid in respect of an interest expropriated, the Minister is of the opinion that the interest is not or is no longer required by the Crown for a public work or other public purpose, or that a more limited interest only is so required, the Minister may give notice that he intends to abandon the interest or the remainder of the interest, as the case may be, by causing a copy of the notice to be sent to each of the persons mentioned in paragraph 19(1)(_c_), each of whom may, within thirty days from the day a copy of the notice was sent to him, serve on the Minister a notice in writing that he elects to

  * (_a_) accept the abandonment, and have the interest or remainder revest in him to the extent that the abandonment would operate to revest it in him; or

  * (_b_) reject the abandonment.

###### Where election to accept abandonment

(2) If each of the persons to whom a notice is sent under subsection (1) serves a notice on the Minister under that subsection that he elects to accept the abandonment, the Minister may cause a notice of abandonment of the interest expropriated or the remainder of the interest, as the case may be, to be sent to each of those persons and to the Attorney General of Canada, who shall thereupon confirm the abandonment by causing the notice to be registered in the office of the registrar where the notice of confirmation was registered.

  * R.S., c. 16(1st Supp.), s. 18.

###### Effect of confirmation of abandonment

**21.** Where an interest expropriated or a remainder of an interest in land is confirmed to be abandoned, the interest expropriated thereupon revests in the persons from whom it was taken or the persons entitled to claim through or under them, or the land thereupon revests in those persons subject to the more limited interest therein retained by the Crown, as the case may be.

  * R.S., c. 16(1st Supp.), s. 19.

###### Duties of registrar

**22.** Every registrar shall receive and permanently preserve in his office such notices and plans as the Attorney General of Canada causes to be registered under this Part, and shall endorse thereon the day, hour and minute when they were received by him as the time of registration and make such entries in his records as will make their registration of public record.

  * R.S., c. 16(1st Supp.), s. 20.

###### Notice conclusive except against Crown

**23.** Unless questioned by the Crown,

  * (_a_) a document purporting to be signed by the Minister shall be deemed to have been so signed;

  * (_b_) it shall be deemed that

    * (i) all of the interests to which a notice of intention relates are,

    * (ii) a more limited interest only to which a notice of confirmation relates is, or

    * (iii) an interest stated in a notice of abandonment to be abandoned or the remainder of the interest, as the case may be, is not or is no longer,

in the opinion of the Minister required by the Crown for a public work or other public purpose; and

  * (_c_) it shall be deemed that, on being caused to be registered by the Attorney General of Canada in the office of the registrar where a notice of intention to expropriate an interest in land was registered, a document purporting to be a notice of confirmation of the intention to expropriate that interest or a more limited interest only in the land is a notice of confirmation thereof thereupon registered in accordance with this Part.

  * R.S., c. 16(1st Supp.), s. 21.

###### Evidence of notice and registration

**24.** A document purporting to be certified by a registrar to be a true copy of a notice or plan registered under this Part at a time stated in the certificate is, without proof of the official character or signature of the registrar, evidence of the facts stated therein and of the registration of the notice or plan at the time so stated.

  * R.S., c. 16(1st Supp.), s. 22.

## Compensation

###### Right to compensation

**25.** (1) Compensation shall be paid by the Crown to each person who, immediately before the registration of a notice of confirmation, was the owner of a right, estate or interest in the land to which the notice relates, to the extent of his expropriated interest, the amount of which compensation shall be equal to the aggregate of

  * (_a_) the value of the expropriated interest at the time of its taking, and

  * (_b_) the amount of any decrease in value of the remaining property of the owner, determined as provided in section 27.

###### Time as of which value to be determined

(2) For the purposes of this section and sections 26 and 27, the time of the taking of an expropriated interest is,

  * (_a_) where an election has been made under subsection (3) by the owner thereof, the time specified by him in his election; and

  * (_b_) in any other case, the time when the notice of confirmation was registered.

###### Election as to time where notice of confirmation not sent until after ninety days from registration

(3) Where no copy of a notice of confirmation was sent to a person whose name is set out in the report of the Attorney General of Canada referred to in subsection 5(2) or who served an objection on the Minister under section 9 until a time more than ninety days after the registration of the notice, that person may, at any time before any compensation is paid to him in respect of any expropriated interest of which he was the owner immediately before the registration of the notice of confirmation, elect to have the value of the interest determined at either

  * (_a_) the time when the notice of confirmation was registered, or

  * (_b_) the time when the copy of the notice of confirmation was sent to him,

as specified by him in his election.

  * R.S., c. 16(1st Supp.), s. 23.

###### Rules for determining value

**26.** (1) The rules set out in this section shall be applied in determining the value of an expropriated interest.

###### Market value defined

(2) Subject to this section, the value of an expropriated interest is the market value thereof, that is to say, the amount that would have been paid for the interest if, at the time of its taking, it had been sold in the open market by a willing seller to a willing buyer.

###### Where owner required to give up occupation

(3) Where the owner of an expropriated interest was in occupation of any land at the time the notice of confirmation was registered and, as a result of the expropriation, it has been necessary for him to give up occupation of the land, the value of the expropriated interest is the greater of

  * (_a_) the market value thereof determined as set out in subsection (2), and

  * (_b_) the aggregate of

    * (i) the market value thereof determined on the basis that the use to which the expropriated interest was being put at the time of its taking was its highest and best use, and

    * (ii) the costs, expenses and losses arising out of or incidental to the owner’s disturbance, including moving to other premises, but if those costs, expenses and losses cannot practically be estimated or determined, there may be allowed in lieu thereof a percentage, not exceeding fifteen, of the market value determined as set out in subparagraph (i),

plus the value to the owner of any element of special economic advantage to him arising out of or incidental to his occupation of the land, to the extent that no other provision is made by this paragraph for the inclusion thereof in determining the value of the expropriated interest.

###### Where Crown has taken physical possession of land

(4) In any case where the Crown has taken physical possession or made use of the land referred to in subsection (3) on the expiration of a period of notice to the owner shorter than the ninety days mentioned in paragraph 19(1)(_c_), there shall be added to the value of the expropriated interest otherwise determined under this section an additional amount equal to ten per cent thereof.

###### Where specially designed building erected on land

(5) Notwithstanding subsection (3), where any parcel of land to which a notice of confirmation relates had any building or other structure erected thereon that was specially designed for use for the purpose of a school, hospital, municipal institution or religious or charitable institution or for any similar purpose, the use of which building or other structure for that purpose by the owner has been rendered impracticable as a result of the expropriation, the value of the expropriated interest is, if the expropriated interest was and, but for the expropriation, would have continued to be used for that purpose and at the time of its taking there was no general demand or market therefor for that purpose, the greater of

  * (_a_) the market value of the expropriated interest determined as set out in subsection (2), and

  * (_b_) the aggregate of

    * (i) the cost of any reasonably alternative interest in land for that purpose, and

    * (ii) the cost, expenses and losses arising out of or incidental to moving to and re-establishment on other premises, but if those costs, expenses and losses cannot practically be estimated or determined, there may be allowed in lieu thereof a percentage, not exceeding fifteen, of the cost determined under subparagraph (i),

minus the amount by which the owner has improved, or may reasonably be expected to improve, his position through re-establishment on other premises.

###### Where Crown has taken physical possession of land

(6) In any case where the Crown has taken physical possession or made use of the parcel of land referred to in subsection (5) on the expiration of a period of notice to the owner shorter than the ninety days mentioned in paragraph 19(1)(_c_), there shall be added to the value of the expropriated interest otherwise determined under this section an additional amount equal to ten per cent thereof.

###### Additional factors

(7) For the purposes of subparagraphs (3)(_b_)(ii) and (5)(_b_)(ii), consideration shall be given to the time and circumstances in which a former owner was allowed to continue in occupation of the land after the Crown became entitled to take physical possession or make use thereof, and to any assistance given by the Minister to enable the former owner to seek and obtain alternative premises.

###### Land used for residence

(8) Where an expropriated interest was, immediately before the registration of a notice of confirmation, being used by the owner thereof for the purposes of his residence and the value of the interest otherwise determined under this section is less than the minimum amount sufficient to enable the owner, at the earlier of

  * (_a_) the time of payment to him of any compensation in respect of the interest, otherwise than pursuant to any offer made to him under section 16, and

  * (_b_) the time when the Crown became entitled to take physical possession or make use of the land to the extent of the interest expropriated,

to relocate his residence in or on premises reasonably equivalent to the premises expropriated, there shall be added to the value of the interest otherwise determined under this section the amount by which that minimum amount exceeds that value.

###### Moving and relocation expenses of owner of leasehold interest

(9) Where an expropriated interest was, immediately before the registration of a notice of confirmation, owned by the owner thereof as a leasehold interest, there shall be substituted for the amount determined under subparagraph (3)(_b_)(ii) or (5)(_b_)(ii), or the amount by which the minimum amount referred to in subsection (8) exceeds the value of the interest referred to therein otherwise determined under this section, as the case may be, such part of that amount as is appropriate having regard to

  * (_a_) the length of the term of the leasehold interest and the portion of the term remaining at the time at which the determination is relevant;

  * (_b_) any right or reasonable prospect of renewal of the term that the owner of the leasehold interest had; and

  * (_c_) any investment in the land by the owner of the leasehold interest and the nature of any business carried on by him thereon.

###### Land subject to security interest

(10) Where an expropriated interest was, immediately before the registration of a notice of confirmation, subject to an interest in land that was held by the owner thereof as security only, in this subsection called a “security interest”,

  * (_a_) the value of the expropriated interest is the aggregate of

    * (i) the value thereof otherwise determined under this section as though it had not been subject to any security interest, and

    * (ii) the amount of any loss or anticipated loss to the owner of the expropriated interest resulting from a difference in rates of interest during the remainder of the period for which any principal amount payable under the terms of the security was advanced, that difference to be calculated on the basis of an assumed rate of interest not in excess of the prevailing rate of interest for an equivalent security, to the extent that no other provision is made by this section for the inclusion of an amount in respect of the loss or anticipated loss in determining the value of the expropriated interest,

less the value of each security interest to which the expropriated interest was subject, determined as provided in paragraph (_b_) but as though no amount were included therein by virtue of subparagraph (ii) of that paragraph;

  * (_b_) the value of the security interest is the aggregate of

    * (i) the principal amount outstanding under the terms of the security, and any interest due or accrued thereunder, at the time of the registration of the notice of confirmation, and

    * (ii) an amount equal to three times the interest element, calculated as a monthly amount, of any payment of interest or of principal and interest payable under the terms of the security at the rate in effect thereunder immediately before the registration of the notice of confirmation,

and where the expropriated interest was subject to more than one security interest, the value of each security interest shall be determined in the order of its priority but in no case shall the value of any security interest to which an expropriated interest was subject exceed the value of the expropriated interest otherwise determined under this section as though it had not been subject to any security interest, less the value of each other security interest the value of which is required by this subsection to be determined in priority thereto; and

  * (_c_) where part only of the interest that was subject to a security interest was expropriated, the value of the security interest is that proportion of the value thereof otherwise determined under this subsection as though the whole of the interest subject to the security interest had been expropriated, that

    * (i) the value of the part only of the interest, otherwise determined under this subsection as though it had not been subject to any security interest,

is of

    * (ii) the value of the whole of the interest otherwise determined under this subsection as though it had not been subject to any security interest,

less the same proportion of the interest element of any payment made under the terms of the security, between the time of the registration of the notice of confirmation and the time of payment of any compensation in respect of the security interest, otherwise than pursuant to any offer made to the owner thereof under section 16.

###### Factors not to be taken into account

(11) In determining the value of an expropriated interest, no account shall be taken of

  * (_a_) any anticipated or actual use by the Crown of the land at any time after the expropriation;

  * (_b_) any value established or claimed to be established by or by reference to any transaction or agreement involving the sale, lease or other disposition of the interest or any part thereof, where the transaction or agreement was entered into after the registration of the notice of intention to expropriate;

  * (_c_) any increase or decrease in the value of the interest resulting from the anticipation of expropriation by the Crown or from any knowledge or expectation, prior to the expropriation, of the public work or other public purpose for which the interest was expropriated; or

  * (_d_) any increase in the value of the interest resulting from its having been put to a use that was contrary to law.

  * R.S., c. 16(1st Supp.), s. 24.

###### Decrease in value of remaining property where severance

**27.** (1) The amount of the decrease in value, if any, of the remaining property of an owner is the value of all of his interests in land immediately before the time of the taking of the expropriated interest, determined as provided in section 26, minus the aggregate of

  * (_a_) the value of the expropriated interest; and

  * (_b_) the value of all his remaining interests in land immediately after the time of the taking of the expropriated interest.

###### Injurious affection, etc., as factor in determining change in value of remaining property

(2) For the purpose of paragraph (1)(_b_), the value of the remaining interests in land of an owner immediately after the time of the taking of the expropriated interest shall be determined as provided in section 26, except that in determining that value account shall be taken of any increase or decrease in the value of any remaining interest in land of the owner, that immediately before the registration of the notice of confirmation was held by him together with the expropriated interest, resulting from the construction or use or anticipated construction or use of any public work on the land to which the notice relates or from the use or anticipated use of that land for any public purpose.

  * R.S., c. 16(1st Supp.), s. 25.

###### Additional factors to be taken into account

**28.** (1) The fact of

  * (_a_) an abandonment or revesting under this Part of an interest or remainder of an interest in land, or

  * (_b_) any undertaking given on behalf of the Crown by the Minister, or by any other person within the scope of his authority, to make any alteration, construct any work or grant or convey any other land or interest therein,

shall be taken into account, in connection with all other circumstances of the case, in determining the amount to be paid to any person claiming compensation for an expropriated interest.

###### Compensation payable where intention to expropriate abandoned

(2) Where an intention to expropriate an interest or remainder of an interest in land has been abandoned, the compensation payable by the Crown to the owner thereof is the amount of any actual loss sustained by the owner, after the time when the notice of intention was registered and before the time when the abandonment of the intention, or the intention to expropriate a more limited interest, as the case may be, was confirmed, in consequence of the registration

  * (_a_) of the notice of intention, where the intention to expropriate the interest has been abandoned; or

  * (_b_) of the notice of intention in so far as that notice relates to the remainder of the interest, where the intention to expropriate the remainder has been abandoned.

###### Application of sections 31 and 32

(3) In relation to the compensation described in subsection (2), the provisions of sections 31 and 32 apply with such modifications as the circumstances require, and as though for the reference in paragraph 31(1)(_a_) to “the registration of the notice of confirmation” there were substituted a reference to the confirmation of the abandonment of the intention.

  * R.S., c. 16(1st Supp.), s. 26.

###### Legal, appraisal and other costs to be paid by Crown

**29.** (1) The Crown shall pay to each person entitled to compensation under this Part an amount equal to the legal, appraisal and other costs reasonably incurred by him in asserting a claim for that compensation, except any of those costs incurred after the institution of any proceedings under sections 31 and 32.

###### Taxing

(2) The costs provided for in subsection (1) may be taxed by the official responsible for taxing costs in the Court.

###### Stay of proceedings

(2) Where a notice referred to in subsection (1) has been served as provided in that subsection, no proceedings under sections 31 and 32 shall be instituted, or if instituted shall be proceeded with, by or on behalf of either the owner or the Attorney General of Canada in respect of the expropriation, until the expiration of sixty days from the serving of the notice, unless before the expiration of those sixty days the negotiator to whom the matter is referred under subsection (4) has made a report to the Minister that he has been unable to effect a settlement and has sent a copy of his report to the owner.

###### Judgment as bar to further claims

(5) A judgment, whether by consent, default or otherwise, in any proceedings under this section or section 31 bars all further claims of the parties thereto and of any persons claiming through or under them, including any claim in respect of dower or of dower not yet open or in respect of any mortgage, hypothec or other right or encumbrance, and the Court shall declare the amount of compensation payable and make such order for the distribution, payment or investment of any compensation money, and for the securing of the rights of all persons interested, as may be necessary.

###### Crown in position of purchaser for value

  * R.S., c. 16(1st Supp.), s. 31.

###### Set-off and recovery of excess compensation
