    * (ii) for an accounting period is the lesser of

the greatest of those usual amounts paid to consumers not exceeding the usual returnable container charge, and

    * (ii) if none of clauses (i)(A) to (D) applies, the portion of the amount that is, at that time, the consideration paid, in the greatest number of cases, by consumers’ recyclers for supplies in the province of used and empty returnable containers of that class from consumers that does not exceed the amount that is, at that time, the returnable container charge charged in the greatest number of cases by suppliers when selling the beverage in returnable containers of that class in the province; and

###### Exception for specified beverage retailer

(3) Subsection (2) does not apply to a supply by a registrant of a beverage in a returnable container in respect of which the registrant is a specified beverage retailer if the registrant elects not to deduct the amount of the returnable container charge in respect of the container in determining the consideration for the supply for the purposes of this Part.

###### Supply of used container

(4) If a person makes a particular supply in a province of a used and empty returnable container (or the material resulting from its compaction),

###### Exception

(5) Subsection (4) does not apply

  * (_a_) for the purposes of section 5 of Part V.1 of Schedule V or section 10 of Part VI of that Schedule; or

  * (_b_) to a supply made in a province of a used and empty returnable container of a particular class (or the material resulting from its compaction) if the usual business practice of the recipient is to pay consideration for supplies in the province of used and empty returnable containers of that class (or the material resulting from their compaction) that is determined based on the value of the material from which the containers are made or is otherwise determined based neither on the amount of the refund for the returnable containers nor on the amount of the returnable container charge in respect of filled and sealed returnable containers of that class containing beverages that are supplied in the province.

###### Supply of recycling service to distributor

(6) For the purposes of this Part (other than section 5 of Part V.1 of Schedule V and section 10 of Part VI of that Schedule), if

the value of the consideration for the particular supply is deemed to be equal to the amount determined by the formula

A - B

where

A 
    is the consideration for the particular supply as otherwise determined for the purposes of this Part; and

A - B

where

A 
    is the consideration for the particular supply as otherwise determined for the purposes of this Part; and
B 
    is the total of all amounts each of which is the refund in that province for a returnable container in respect of which that consideration is paid or payable.

(8) Subject to subsection (9), if a registrant acquires, in a province in which an Act prescribed for the purposes of paragraph (2)(_b_) applies, a beverage in a returnable container for the purpose of making in that province a taxable supply of the beverage in the container in circumstances in which the registrant will charge a returnable container charge in respect of the container and be required to collect tax in respect of the supply,

  * (_a_) if a supply of a service in respect of the container is deemed under that paragraph to have been made to the registrant, the tax in respect of the supply of the service shall not be included in determining an input tax credit of the registrant; and

  * (_b_) if the registrant makes a supply in that province of the beverage in circumstances in which the registrant is deemed under that paragraph to have made a supply of a service in respect of the container, neither the consideration for the supply of that service nor any tax in respect of that supply shall be included in determining the net tax of the registrant.

###### Non-application of special rules

(9) If a registrant is deemed under paragraph (2)(_b_) to have received or made at any time a supply in a province of a service in respect of a returnable container of a particular class containing a particular beverage, paragraph (8)(_a_) or (_b_), as the case may be, does not apply in respect of the supply if

  * (_a_) the usual business practice of the registrant at that time is to charge, when making supplies in the province of the particular beverage contained in returnable containers of that class, a returnable container charge that is not equal to the returnable container charge that the registrant pays in respect of returnable containers of that class containing the particular beverage when supplies of the beverage are made to the registrant in the province; or

  * (_b_) the registrant is a specified beverage retailer in respect of the container and elects under subsection (3) not to deduct the amount of the returnable container charge charged by the registrant in determining the consideration for the supply by the registrant of the particular beverage in the returnable container.

###### Change in practice — beginning to apply special rules

(10) If, after changing their usual business practice with respect to supplies of a particular beverage in returnable containers of a particular class from the practice described in subsection (9), a registrant makes, at a particular time, in a province in which an Act prescribed for the purposes of paragraph (2)(_b_) applies, a supply of the particular beverage in a returnable container of that class in circumstances in which the registrant is deemed under that paragraph to have made a supply of a service in respect of the container and that supply of the beverage is the first supply by the registrant of the particular beverage in a returnable container of that class in respect of which paragraph (8)(_b_) applies since the change in practice, the registrant is deemed, for the purposes of this Part,

  * (_a_) to have made, at the particular time, a taxable supply of a service in respect of each filled and sealed returnable container of that class containing the particular beverage

    * (i) that was, immediately before the particular time, held by the registrant for the purpose of making a taxable supply of the particular beverage in the province in circumstances in which the registrant would be deemed under paragraph (2)(_b_) to have made a supply of a service in respect of the container, and

    * (ii) that was last supplied to the registrant in the province in circumstances in which the registrant was deemed under that paragraph to have received a supply of a service in respect of which the registrant was entitled to claim an input tax credit or would have been so entitled if tax would, in the absence of section 156 or 167, have been payable in respect of that supply of the service; and

  * (_b_) to have collected, at the particular time, tax in respect of each supply of a service in respect of a returnable container that is deemed under paragraph (_a_) to have been made by the registrant equal to the tax that was payable or would, in the absence of section 156 or 167, have been payable by the registrant in respect of the supply to the registrant of the service referred to in subparagraph (_a_)(ii) in respect of that container.

###### Change in practice — ceasing to apply special rules

(11) If, after changing their usual business practice with respect to supplies of a particular beverage in returnable containers of a particular class to the practice described in subsection (9), a registrant makes, at a particular time, in a province in which an Act prescribed for the purposes of paragraph (2)(_b_) applies, a supply of the particular beverage in a returnable container of that class in circumstances in which the registrant is deemed under that paragraph to have made a supply of a service in respect of the container and the supply is the first supply by the registrant of the particular beverage in a returnable container of that class in respect of which paragraph (8)(_b_) would have applied but for the change in practice, the registrant is deemed, for the purposes of this Part,

  * (_a_) to have received, at the particular time, for use exclusively in a commercial activity of the registrant, a taxable supply of a service in respect of each filled and sealed returnable container of that class containing the particular beverage

    * (i) that was, immediately before the particular time, held by the registrant for the purpose of making a taxable supply of the particular beverage in the province in circumstances in which the registrant would be deemed under paragraph (2)(_b_) to have made a supply of a service in respect of the container, and

    * (ii) that was last supplied to the registrant in the province in circumstances in which the registrant was deemed under that paragraph to have received a supply of a service in respect of which, owing solely to paragraph (8)(_a_), the registrant was not entitled to claim an input tax credit or would not have been so entitled if tax would, in the absence of section 156 or 167, have been payable in respect of that supply of the service; and

  * (_b_) to have paid, at the particular time, tax in respect of each supply of a service in respect of a returnable container that is deemed under paragraph (_a_) to have been received by the registrant equal to the tax that was or would, in the absence of section 156 or 167, have been payable by the registrant in respect of the supply to the registrant of the service referred to in subparagraph (_a_)(ii) in respect of that container.

###### Ceasing to be registrant while special rules apply

(12) If a person who makes supplies of a particular beverage in filled and sealed returnable containers of a particular class in a province in which an Act prescribed for the purposes of paragraph (2)(_b_) applies ceases at any time to be a registrant, the person is deemed, for the purposes of this Part,

  * (_a_) to have received, immediately before that time, a supply of a service in respect of each filled and sealed returnable container of that class containing the particular beverage that was held by the person immediately before that time and in respect of which paragraph (8)(_b_) would have applied if the particular beverage in the container had been supplied by the person immediately before that time in circumstances in which the person would have been deemed under paragraph (2)(_b_) to have made a supply of a service in respect of the container; and

  * (_b_) to have paid, immediately before that time, tax in respect of each supply of a service in respect of a returnable container that is deemed under paragraph (_a_) to have been received by the person equal to the tax that was payable or would, in the absence of section 156 or 167, have been payable by the person in respect of the supply to the person of the service that was deemed under paragraph (2)(_b_) to have been made to the person when the person acquired the partic­ular beverage.

###### Deemed tax collected where s. 156 or 167 applies

(14) For the purposes of this Part, if

  * (_a_) a supplier makes a supply in a province of a beverage in a filled and sealed returnable container to a registrant and is deemed under paragraph (2)(_b_) to have made at any time a supply to the registrant of a service in respect of the container,

  * (_b_) because of section 156 or 167, no tax is payable in respect of the supplies to the registrant of the beverage and of the service,

  * (_c_) by reason only of paragraph (8)(_a_), the registrant would not have been entitled to claim an input tax credit in respect of the tax that would, in the absence of section 156 or 167, have been payable in respect of the supply of the service, and

  * (_d_) paragraph (8)(_b_) does not apply in respect of the supplies to the registrant of the beverage and the service in determining the net tax of the supplier,

the registrant is deemed to have made, at that time, a particular taxable supply in the province of a service in respect of the container for consideration equal to the amount that would, without reference to section 156, be the value of the consideration for the supply of the service that is deemed under paragraph (2)(_b_) to have been made to the registrant in respect of the container and the registrant is deemed to have collected at that time tax in respect of the particular supply calculated on that consideration.

###### Deemed tax paid where s. 156 or 167 applies

(15) For the purposes of this Part, if

  * (_a_) a supplier makes a supply in a province of a beverage in a filled and sealed returnable container to a registrant and is deemed under paragraph (2)(_b_) to have made at any time a supply to the registrant of a service in respect of the container,

  * (_b_) because of section 156 or 167, no tax is payable in respect of the supplies to the registrant of the beverage and of the service,

  * (_c_) paragraph (8)(_a_) would not have applied to the registrant in respect of the tax that would, in the absence of section 156 or 167, have been payable in respect of the supply of the service, and

  * (_d_) paragraph (8)(_b_) applies in respect of the supplies by the supplier to the registrant of the beverage and the service in determining the net tax of the supplier,

the registrant is deemed to have received, at that time, a particular taxable supply in the province of a service in respect of the container for consideration equal to the amount that would, without reference to section 156, be the value of the consideration for the supply of the service that is deemed under paragraph (2)(_b_) to have been made to the registrant in respect of the container, the registrant is deemed to have paid, at that time, tax in respect of the particular supply calculated on that consideration and the registrant is deemed to have acquired that service for the same purpose as that for which the registrant acquired the beverage.

###### Fair market value of beverage in filled and sealed container

(16) For the purposes of this Part, if a beverage in a filled and sealed returnable container in respect of which there is a returnable container charge is held at any time by a person for consumption, use or supply in a province in the course of commercial activities of the person, the fair market value of the beverage at that time is deemed not to include the amount that would be determined as the refund for the container if the beverage were supplied in the province by the person at that time in the filled and sealed container.

###### Basic tax content of beverage in filled and sealed container

(17) The basic tax content at any time of a beverage in a filled and sealed returnable container that is held at that time by a person shall be determined as if the tax payable, if any, in respect of the last supply of a service in respect of the container that was deemed under subsection (2) or (15) to have been made to the person, and the tax payable, if any, in respect of the last supply of a service in respect of the container that was deemed under subsection (14) to have been made by the person, were additional tax payable by the person in respect of the last acquisition of the beverage by the person.

###### Addition to net tax

(18) If

  * (_a_) a registrant makes a supply in a province of a beverage in a returnable container of a particular class in respect of which the registrant is a specified beverage retailer,

  * (_b_) paragraph (2)(_a_) applies in determining, for the purposes of this Part, the consideration for the supply, and

  * (_c_) the registrant makes at any time a supply in the province of that container used and empty for consideration without having acquired it used and empty for consideration,

the registrant shall, in determining the net tax of the registrant for the reporting period that includes that time, add the amount determined by the formula

A × B

where

A 
    is

  * (i) if the province is a participating province, the total of the rate of tax under subsection 165(1) and the tax rate for the province, and

  * (ii) in any other case, the rate of tax under subsection 165(1); and

  * 2. For the purposes of this Schedule,

    * (_a_) a floating home, and

    * (_b_) a mobile home that is not affixed to land

are each deemed to be tangible personal property and not real property.

  * 3. For the purposes of this Schedule, where an agreement for the supply of property or a service is entered into but the property is never delivered to the recipient or the service is never performed, the property is deemed to have been delivered, or the service is deemed to have been performed, where the property or service was to be delivered or performed, as the case may be, under the terms of the agreement.

  * 4. Where, for the purpose of determining, under this Schedule, if a supply is made in a province, reference is made to the ordinary location of property and, from time to time, the supplier and recipient mutually agree upon what is to be the ordinary location of the property at a particular time, that location is deemed, for the purposes of this Schedule, to be the ordinary location of that property at the particular time.

    * (_b_) in any other case,

      * (i) where the property is a specified motor vehicle, it is required, at the time the supply is made, to be registered under the laws of the province relating to the registration of motor vehicles, and
