**287.** (1) Despite section 286, if, on ex parte application by the Minister, a judge is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the collection of all or any part of an amount assessed in respect of a person would be jeopardized by a delay in the collection of the amount, the judge shall, on such terms as the judge considers reasonable in the circumstances, authorize the Minister to take without delay any of the actions described in subsection 286(1) with respect to the amount.

###### Registration in court

(2) On production to the Federal Court, a certificate in respect of a debtor shall be registered in the Court and when so registered has the same effect, and all proceedings may be taken on the certificate, as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court against the debtor for a debt in the amount certified plus interest on the amount as provided under this Act to the day of payment and, for the purposes of those proceedings, the certificate is deemed to be a judgment of the Court against the debtor for a debt due to Her Majesty and enforceable as such.

###### Costs

(3) All reasonable costs and charges incurred or paid for the registration in the Court of a certificate or in respect of any proceedings taken to collect the amount certified are recoverable in like manner as if they had been included in the amount certified in the certificate when it was registered.

  * (_a_) a judgment of the superior court of the province against a person for a debt owing by the person, or

  * (_b_) an amount payable or required to be remitted by a person in the province in respect of a debt owing to Her Majesty in right of the province

may be filed, registered or otherwise recorded in accordance with the law of the province to create a charge, lien or priority on, or a binding interest in, the property or interest.

in the same manner and to the same extent as if the memorial were a document evidencing a judgment referred to in paragraph (4)(_a_) or an amount referred to in paragraph (4)(_b_), and the charge, lien, priority or binding interest created shall be subordinate to any charge, lien, priority or binding interest in respect of which all steps necessary to make it effective against other creditors were taken before the time the memorial was filed, registered or otherwise recorded.

###### Proceedings in respect of memorial

(6) If a memorial is filed, registered or otherwise recorded in a province under subsection (4), proceedings may be taken in the province in respect of the memorial, including proceedings

in the same manner and to the same extent as if the memorial were a document evidencing a judgment referred to in paragraph (4)(_a_) or an amount referred to in paragraph (4)(_b_), except that, if in any such proceeding or as a condition precedent to any such proceeding, any order, consent or ruling is required under the law of the province to be made or given by the superior court of the province or by a judge or official of the court, a like order, consent or ruling may be made or given by the Federal Court or by a judge or official of the Federal Court and, when so made or given, has the same effect for the purposes of the proceeding as if it were made or given by the superior court of the province or by a judge or official of the court.

###### Presentation of documents

(7) If

  * (_a_) a memorial is presented for filing, registration or other recording under subsection (4), or a document relating to the memorial is presented for filing, registration or other recording for the purpose of any proceeding described in subsection (6), to any official of a property registry system of a province, or

  * (_b_) access is sought to any person, place or thing in a province to make the filing, registration or other recording,

the memorial or document shall be accepted for filing, registration or other recording or the access shall be granted, as the case may be, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the memorial or document relating to the memorial were a document evidencing a judgment referred to in paragraph (4)(_a_) or an amount referred to in paragraph (4)(_b_) for the purpose of a like proceeding, except that, if the memorial or document is issued by the Federal Court or signed or certified by a judge or official of the Court, any affidavit, declaration or other evidence required under the law of the province to be provided with or to accompany the memorial or document in the proceedings is deemed to have been provided with or to have accompanied the memorial or document as so required.

###### Sale, etc.

(8) Despite any law of Canada or of a province, a sheriff or other person shall not, without the written consent of the Minister, sell or otherwise dispose of any property or publish any notice or otherwise advertise in respect of any sale or other disposition of any property pursuant to any process issued or charge, lien, priority or binding interest created in any proceeding to collect an amount certified in a certificate made under subsection (1), interest on the amount or costs, but if that consent is subsequently given, any property that would have been affected by such a process, charge, lien, priority or binding interest if the Minister’s consent had been given at the time the process was issued or the charge, lien, priority or binding interest was created, as the case may be, shall be bound, seized, attached, charged or otherwise affected as it would be if that consent had been given at the time the process was issued or the charge, lien, priority or binding interest was created, as the case may be.

###### Completion of notices, etc.

(9) If information required to be set out by any sheriff or other person in a minute, notice or document required to be completed for any purpose cannot, because of subsection (8), be so set out without the written consent of the Minister, the sheriff or other person shall complete the minute, notice or document to the extent possible without that information and, when that consent of the Minister is given, a further minute, notice or document setting out all the information shall be completed for the same purpose, and the sheriff or other person, having complied with this subsection, is deemed to have complied with the Act, regulation or rule requiring the information to be set out in the minute, notice or document.

###### Application for an order

(10) A sheriff or other person who is unable, because of subsection (8) or (9), to comply with any law or rule of court is bound by any order made by a judge of the Federal Court, on an ex parte application by the Minister, for the purpose of giving effect to the proceeding, charge, lien, priority or binding interest.

  * (_a_) to be a claim that is secured by a security and that, subject to subsection 87(2) of that Act, ranks as a secured claim under that Act; and

  * (_b_) to also be a claim referred to in paragraph 86(2)(_a_) of that Act.

###### Details in certificates and memorials

(12) Despite any law of Canada or of the legislature of a province, in any certificate in respect of a debtor, any memorial evidencing a certificate or any writ or document issued for the purpose of collecting an amount certified, it is sufficient for all purposes

  * (_a_) to set out, as the amount payable by the debtor, the total of amounts payable by the debtor without setting out the separate amounts making up that total; and

  * (_b_) to refer to the rate of interest to be charged on the separate amounts making up the amount payable in general terms as interest at the prescribed rate under this Act applicable from time to time on amounts payable to the Receiver General, without indicating the specific rates of interest to be charged on each of the separate amounts or to be charged for any period.

###### Garnishment

**289.** (1) If the Minister has knowledge or suspects that a person is, or will be within one year, liable to make a payment to another person who is liable to pay an amount under this Act (in this section referred to as a “debtor”), the Minister may, by notice in writing, require the person to pay without delay, if the money is immediately payable, and in any other case, as and when the money becomes payable, the money otherwise payable to the debtor in whole or in part to the Receiver General on account of the debtor’s liability under this Act.

###### Garnishment of loans or advances

(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), if the Minister has knowledge or suspects that within 90 days

  * (_a_) a bank, credit union, trust company or other similar person (in this section referred to as the “institution”) will loan or advance money to, or make a payment on behalf of, or make a payment in respect of a negotiable instrument issued by, a debtor who is indebted to the institution and who has granted security in respect of the indebtedness, or

  * (_b_) a person, other than an institution, will loan or advance money to, or make a payment on behalf of, a debtor who the Minister knows or suspects

    * (i) is employed by, or is engaged in providing services or property to, that person or was or will be, within 90 days, so employed or engaged, or

    * (ii) if that person is a corporation, is not dealing at arm’s length with that person,

the Minister may, by notice in writing, require the institution or person, as the case may be, to pay in whole or in part to the Receiver General on account of the debtor’s liability under this Act the money that would otherwise be so loaned, advanced or paid.

###### Effect of receipt

(3) A receipt issued by the Minister for money paid as required under this section is a good and sufficient discharge of the original liability to the extent of the payment.

###### Effect of requirement

(4) If the Minister has, under this section, required a person to pay to the Receiver General on account of the liability under this Act of a debtor money otherwise payable by the person to the debtor as interest, rent, remuneration, a dividend, an annuity or other periodic payment, the requirement applies to all such payments to be made by the person to the debtor until the liability under this Act is satisfied, and operates to require payments to the Receiver General out of each such payment of any amount that is stipulated by the Minister in a notice in writing.

  * (_b_) the amount that the institution or person was required under that subsection to pay to the Receiver General.

###### Assessment

(7) The Minister may assess any person for any amount payable under this section by the person to the Receiver General and, if the Minister sends a notice of assessment, sections 188 to 205 apply with any modifications that the circumstances require.

###### Effect of payment as required

(9) If an amount that would otherwise have been advanced, loaned or paid to or on behalf of the debtor is paid by a person to the Receiver General in accordance with a notice from the Minister issued under this section or with an assessment under subsection (7), the person is deemed for all purposes to have advanced, loaned or paid the amount to or on behalf of the debtor.

###### Recovery by deduction or set-off

**291.** For the purpose of collecting debts owed by a person to Her Majesty under this Act, the Minister may purchase or otherwise acquire any interest in the person’s property that the Minister is given a right to acquire in legal proceedings or under a court order or that is offered for sale or redemption, and may dispose of any interest so acquired in any manner that the Minister considers reasonable.

###### Money seized from debtor

**292.** (1) If the Minister has knowledge or suspects that a person is holding money that was seized by a police officer in the course of administering or enforcing the criminal law of Canada from another person who is liable to pay any duty, interest or other amount under this Act (in this section referred to as the “debtor”) and that is restorable to the debtor, the Minister may in writing require the person to turn over the money otherwise restorable to the debtor, in whole or in part, to the Receiver General on account of the debtor’s liability under this Act.

###### Receipt of Minister

(2) A receipt issued by the Minister for money turned over is a good and sufficient discharge of the requirement to restore the money to the debtor to the extent of the amount so turned over.

###### Disposition

(2) Things that have been seized under subsection (1) shall be kept for 10 days at the expense and risk of the owner.
