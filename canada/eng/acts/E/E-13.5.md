## SCHEDULE - (Section 2) - AGREEMENT ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT

The contracting parties,

Committed to the fundamental principles of multiparty democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and market economics;

Recalling the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and in particular its Declaration on Principles;

Welcoming the intent of Central and Eastern European countries to further the practical implementation of multiparty democracy, strengthening democratic institutions, the rule of law and respect for human rights and their willingness to implement reforms in order to evolve towards market-oriented economies;

Considering the importance of close and coordinated cooperation in order to promote the economic progress of Central and Eastern European countries to help their economies become more internationally competitive and assist them in their reconstruction and development and thus to reduce, where appropriate, any risks related to the financing of their economies;

Convinced that the establishment of a multilateral financial institution which is European in its basic character and broadly international in its membership would help serve these ends and would constitute a new and unique structure of cooperation in Europe;

Have agreed to establish hereby the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (hereinafter called “the Bank”) which shall operate in accordance with the following:

## CHAPTER I  
PURPOSE, FUNCTIONS AND MEMBERSHIP

### Article 1  
Purpose

In contributing to economic progress and reconstruction, the purpose of the Bank shall be to foster the transition towards open market-oriented economies and to promote private and entrepreneurial initiative in the Central and Eastern European countries committed to and applying the principles of multiparty democracy, pluralism and market economics. The purpose of the Bank may also be carried out in Mongolia subject to the same conditions. Accordingly, any reference in this Agreement and its annexes to “Central and Eastern European countries”, “countries from Central and Eastern Europe”, “recipient country (or countries)” or “recipient member country (or countries)” shall refer to Mongolia as well.

### Article 2  
Functions

  * 1. To fulfil on a long-term basis its purpose of fostering the transition of Central and Eastern European countries towards open market-oriented economies and the promotion of private and entrepreneurial initiative, the Bank shall assist the recipient member countries to implement structural and sectoral economic reforms, including demonopolization, decentralization and privatization, to help their economies become fully integrated into the international economy by measures:

    * (i) to promote, through private and other interested investors, the establishment, improvement and expansion of productive, competitive and private sector activity, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises;

    * (ii) to mobilize domestic and foreign capital and experienced management to the end described in (i);

    * (iii) to foster productive investment, including in the service and financial sectors, and in related infrastructure where that is necessary to support private and entrepreneurial initiative, thereby assisting in making a competitive environment and raising productivity, the standard of living and conditions of labour;

    * (iv) to provide technical assistance for the preparation, financing and implementation of relevant projects, whether individual or in the context of specific investment programmes;

    * (v) to stimulate and encourage the development of capital markets;

    * (vi) to give support to sound and economically viable projects involving more than one recipient member country;

    * (vii) to promote in the full range of its activities environmentally sound and sustainable development; and

    * (viii) to undertake such other activities and provide such other services as may further these functions.

  * 2. In carrying out the functions referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the Bank shall work in close cooperation with all its members and, in such manner as it may deem appropriate within the terms of this Agreement, with the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and shall cooperate with the United Nations and its Specialised Agencies and other related bodies, and any entity, whether public or private, concerned with the economic development of, and investment in, Central and Eastern European countries.

### Article 3  
Membership

  * 1. Membership in the Bank shall be open:

    * (i) to (1) European countries and (2) non-European countries which are members of the International Monetary Fund; and

    * (ii) to the European Economic Community and the European Investment Bank.

  * 2. Countries eligible for membership under paragraph 1 of this Article, which do not become members in accordance with Article 61 of this Agreement, may be admitted, under such terms and conditions as the Bank may determine, to membership in the Bank upon the affirmative vote of not less than two thirds of the Governors, representing not less than three fourths of the total voting power of the members.

## CHAPTER II  
CAPITAL

### Article 4  
Authorized Capital Stock

  * 1. The original authorized capital stock shall be ten thousand million (10,000,000,000) ECU. It shall be divided into one million (1,000,000) shares, having a par value of ten thousand (10,000) ECU each, which shall be available for subscription only by members in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of this Agreement.

  * 2. The original capital stock shall be divided into paid-in shares and callable shares. The initial total aggregate par value of paid-in shares shall be three thousand million (3,000,000,000) ECU.

  * 3. The authorized capital stock may be increased at such time and under such terms as may seem advisable, by a vote of not less than two thirds of the Governors, representing not less than three fourths of the total voting power of the members.

### Article 5  
Subscription of Shares

  * 1. Each member shall subscribe to shares of the capital stock of the Bank, subject to fulfilment of the member’s legal requirements. Each subscription to the original authorized capital stock shall be for paid-in shares and callable shares in the proportion of three (3) to seven (7). The initial number of shares available to be subscribed to by Signatories to this Agreement which become members in accordance with Article 61 of this Agreement shall be that set forth in Annex A. No member shall have an initial subscription of less than one hundred (100) shares.

  * 2. The initial number of shares to be subscribed to by countries which are admitted to membership in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 3 of this Agreement shall be determined by the Board of Governors; provided, however, that no such subscription shall be authorized which would have the effect of reducing the percentage of capital stock held by countries which are members of the European Economic Community, together with the European Economic Community and the European Investment Bank, below the majority of the total subscribed capital stock.

  * 3. The Board of Governors shall at intervals of not more than five (5) years review the capital stock of the Bank. In case of an increase in the authorized capital stock, each member shall have a reasonable opportunity to subscribe, under such uniform terms and conditions as the Board of Governors shall determine, to a proportion of the increase in stock equivalent to the proportion which its stock subscribed bears to the total subscribed capital stock immediately prior to such increase. No member shall be obliged to subscribe to any part of an increase of capital stock.

  * 4. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article, the Board of Governors may, at the request of a member, increase the subscription of that member, or allocate shares to that member within the authorized capital stock which are not taken up by other members; provided, however, that such increase shall not have the effect of reducing the percentage of capital stock held by countries which are members of the European Economic Community, together with the European Economic Community and the European Investment Bank, below the majority of the total subscribed capital stock.

  * 5. Shares of stock initially subscribed to by members shall be issued at par. Other shares shall be issued at par unless the Board of Governors, by a vote of not less than two thirds of the Governors, representing not less than two thirds of the total voting power of the members, decides to issue them in special circumstances on other terms.

  * 6. Shares of stock shall not be pledged or encumbered in any manner whatsoever, and they shall not be transferable except to the Bank in accordance with Chapter VII of this Agreement.

  * 7. The liability of the members on shares shall be limited to the unpaid portion of their issue price. No member shall be liable, by reason of its membership, for obligations of the Bank.

### Article 6  
Payment of Subscriptions

  * 1. Payment of the paid-in shares of the amount initially subscribed to by each Signatory to this Agreement, which becomes a member in accordance with Article 61 of this Agreement, shall be made in five (5) instalments of twenty (20) per cent each of such amount. The first instalment shall be paid by each member within sixty (60) days after the date of the entry into force of this Agreement, or after the date of deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval in accordance with Article 61, if this latter is later than the date of the entry into force. The remaining four (4) instalments shall each become due successively one year from the date on which the preceding instalment became due and shall each, subject to the legislative requirements of each member, be paid.

  * 2. Fifty (50) per cent of payment of each instalment pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, or by a member admitted in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 3 of this Agreement, may be made in promissory notes or other obligations issued by such member and denominated in ECU, in United States dollars or in Japanese yen, to be drawn down as the Bank needs funds for disbursement as a result of its operations. Such notes or obligations shall be non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing and payable to the Bank at par value upon demand. Demands upon such notes or obligations shall, over reasonable periods of time, be made so that the value of such demands in ECU at the time of demand from each member is proportional to the number of paid-in shares subscribed to and held by each such member depositing such notes or obligations.

  * 3. All payment obligations of a member in respect of subscription to shares in the initial capital stock shall be settled either in ECU, in United States dollars or in Japanese yen on the basis of the average exchange rate of the relevant currency in terms of the ECU for the period from 30 September 1989 to March 1990 inclusive.

  * 4. Payment of the amount subscribed to the callable capital stock of the Bank shall be subject to call, taking account of Articles 17 and 42 of this Agreement, only as and when required by the Bank to meet its liabilities.

  * 5. In the event of a call referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, payment shall be made by the member in ECU, in United States dollars or in Japanese yen. Such calls shall be uniform in ECU value upon each callable share calculated at the time of the call.

  * 6. The Bank shall determine the place for any payment under this Article not later than one month after the inaugural meeting of its Board of Governors, provided that, before such determination, the payment of the first instalment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be made to the European Investment Bank, as trustee for the Bank.

  * 7. For subscriptions other than those described in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article, payments by a member in respect of subscription to paid-in shares in the authorized capital stock shall be made in ECU, in United States dollars or in Japanese yen whether in cash or in promissory notes or in other obligations.

  * 8. For the purposes of this Article, payment or denomination in ECU shall include payment or denomination in any fully convertible currency which is equivalent on the date of payment or encashment to the value of the relevant obligation in ECU.

### Article 7

  * (i) authorized capital stock of the Bank, including both paid-in and callable shares, subscribed to pursuant to Article 5 of this Agreement;

  * 2. At the time a member ceases to be a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of such former member’s shares as a part of the settlement of accounts with such former member in accordance with the provisions of this Article. For this purpose, the repurchase price of the shares shall be the value shown by the books of the Bank on the date of cessation of membership, with the original purchase price of each share being its maximum value.

  * 3. The payment for shares repurchased by the Bank under this Article shall be governed by the following conditions:

    * (i) any amount due to the former member for its shares shall be withheld so long as the former member, its central bank or any of its agencies or instrumentalities remains liable, as borrower or guarantor, to the Bank and such amount may, at the option of the Bank, be applied on any such liability as it matures. No amount shall be withheld on account of the liability of the former member resulting from its subscription for shares in accordance with paragraphs 4, 5 and 7 of Article 6 of this Agreement. In any event, no amount due to a member for its shares shall be paid until six (6) months after the date upon which the member ceases to be a member;

    * (ii) payments for shares may be made from time to time, upon their surrender by the former member, to the extent by which the amount due as the repurchase price in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article exceeds the aggregate amount of liabilities on loans, equity investments and guarantees in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph until the former member has received the full repurchase price;

    * (iii) payments shall be made on such conditions and in such fully convertible currencies, or ECU, and on such dates, as the Bank determines; and

    * (iv) if losses are sustained by the Bank on any guarantees, participations in loans, or loans which were outstanding on the date when the member ceased to be a member, or if a net loss is sustained by the Bank on equity investments held by it on such date, and the amount of such losses exceeds the amount of the reserves provided against losses on the date when the member ceased to be a member, such former member shall repay, upon demand, the amount by which the repurchase price of its shares would have been reduced if the losses had been taken into account when the repurchase price was determined. In addition, the former member shall remain liable on any call for unpaid subscriptions under paragraph 4 of Article 6 of this Agreement, to the extent that it would have been required to respond if the impairment of capital had occurred and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price of its shares was determined.

  * 4. If the Bank terminates its operations pursuant to Article 41 of this Agreement within six (6) months of the date upon which any member ceases to be a member, all rights of such former member shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Articles 41 to 43 of this Agreement.

  * 2. Creditors on ordinary operations holding direct claims shall be paid first out of the assets of the Bank, secondly out of the payments to be made to the Bank in respect of unpaid paid-in shares, and then out of payments to be made to the Bank in respect of callable capital stock. Before making any payments to creditors holding direct claims, the Board of Directors shall make such arrangements as are necessary, in its judgment, to ensure a pro rata distribution among holders of direct and holders of contingent claims.

### Article 43

  * 2. Any distribution of the assets of the Bank to the members shall be in proportion to the capital stock held by each member and shall be effected at such times and under such conditions as the Bank shall deem fair and equitable. The shares of assets distributed need not be uniform as to type of assets. No member shall be entitled to receive its share in such a distribution of assets until it has settled all of its obligations to the Bank.

A majority vote of the arbitrators shall be sufficient to reach a decision which shall be final and binding upon the parties. The third arbitrator shall have full power to settle all questions of procedure in any case where the parties are in disagreement with respect thereto.

### Article 59  
Approval Deemed Given

Whenever the approval or the acceptance of any member is required before any act may be done by the Bank, except under Article 56 of this Agreement, approval or acceptance shall be deemed to have been given unless the member presents an objection within such reasonable period as the Bank may fix in notifying the member of the proposed act.
