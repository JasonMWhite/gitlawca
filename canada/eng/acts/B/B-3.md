  * (_c_) the failure to issue the order is likely to result in irreparable damage to the insolvent person.

###### No delay on vote on proposal

(4) If the parties to the collective agreement agree to revise the collective agreement after proceedings have been commenced under this Act in respect of the insolvent person, the bargaining agent that is a party to the agreement has a claim, as an unsecured creditor, for an amount equal to the value of concessions granted by the bargaining agent with respect to the remaining term of the collective agreement.

The court may make the order only after the insolvent person has been authorized to serve a notice to bargain under subsection (1).

  * (_a_) whether the process leading to the proposed sale or disposition was reasonable in the circumstances;

  * (_b_) whether the trustee approved the process leading to the proposed sale or disposition;

  * (_c_) whether the trustee filed with the court a report stating that in their opinion the sale or disposition would be more beneficial to the creditors than a sale or disposition under a bankruptcy;

  * (_d_) the extent to which the creditors were consulted;

  * (_e_) the effects of the proposed sale or disposition on the creditors and other interested parties; and

  * (_f_) whether the consideration to be received for the assets is reasonable and fair, taking into account their market value.

###### Additional factors — related persons

(5) If the proposed sale or disposition is to a person who is related to the insolvent person, the court may, after considering the factors referred to in subsection (4), grant the authorization only if it is satisfied that

  * (_a_) good faith efforts were made to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets to persons who are not related to the insolvent person; and

  * (_b_) the consideration to be received is superior to the consideration that would be received under any other offer made in accordance with the process leading to the proposed sale or disposition.

  * (_c_) a person who is related to a person described in paragraph (_a_) or (_b_).

###### Assets may be disposed of free and clear

###### Restriction — employers

(8) The court may grant the authorization only if the court is satisfied that the insolvent person can and will make the payments that would have been required under paragraphs 60(1.3)(_a_) and (1.5)(_a_) if the court had approved the proposal.

###### Lessor may challenge

(2) Within fifteen days after being given notice of the disclaimer or resiliation of a lease under subsection (1), the lessor may apply to the court for a declaration that subsection (1) does not apply in respect of that lease, and the court, on notice to any parties that it may direct, shall, subject to subsection (3), make that declaration.

###### Circumstances for not making declaration

(3) No declaration under subsection (2) shall be made if the court is satisfied that the insolvent person would not be able to make a viable proposal without the disclaimer or resiliation of the lease and all other leases that the lessee has disclaimed or resiliated under subsection (1).

(4) If a lease is disclaimed or resiliated under subsection (1),

(5) If the official receiver determines that the amount required to be paid by the bankrupt is substantially not in accordance with the appli­cable standards, the official receiver shall recommend to the trustee and to the bankrupt an amount required to be paid that the official receiver determines is in accordance with the applicable standards.

###### Trustee may fix another amount

(5.1) On receipt of the official receiver’s recommendation, the trustee may fix, having regard to the applicable standards, another amount as the amount that the bankrupt is required to pay to the estate of the bankrupt, and if the trustee does so, the trustee shall

  * (_b_) take reasonable measures to ensure that the bankrupt complies with the requirement to pay.

###### Creditor may request mediation

(7) On a creditor’s request made within 30 days after the day on which the trustee informed the creditor of the amount fixed under subsection (4) or (5.1), the trustee shall, within five days after the day on which the 30-day period ends, send to the official receiver a request, in the prescribed form, that the matter of the amount that the bankrupt is required to pay be determined by mediation and send a copy of the request to the bankrupt and the creditor.

###### Mediation procedure

(8) A mediation shall be in accordance with prescribed procedures.

(9) Documents contained in a file on the mediation of a matter under this section form part of the records referred to in subsection 11.1(2).

###### Application to court to fix amount

(10) The trustee may, in any of the following circumstances — and shall apply if requested to do so by the official receiver in the circumstances referred to in paragraph (_a_) — apply to the court to fix, by order, in accordance with the applicable standards, and having regard to the personal and family situation of the bankrupt, the amount that the bankrupt is required to pay to the estate of the bankrupt:

  * (_a_) if the trustee has not implemented a recommendation made by the official receiver under subsection (5);

  * (_b_) if the matter submitted to mediation has not been resolved by the mediation; or

  * (_c_) if the bankrupt has failed to comply with the requirement to pay as determined under this section.

###### Fixing fair and reasonable remuneration in the case of related persons

(11) The court may fix an amount that is fair and reasonable

  * (_a_) as salary, wages or other remuneration for the services being performed by a bankrupt for a person employing the bankrupt, or

  * (_b_) as payment for or commission in respect of any services being performed by a bankrupt for a person,

where the person is related to the bankrupt, and the court may, by order, determine the part of the salary, wages or other remuneration, or the part of the payment or commission, that shall be paid to the trustee on the basis of the amount so fixed by the court, unless it appears to the court that the services have been performed for the benefit of the bankrupt and are not of any substantial benefit to the person for whom they were performed.

###### Modification of order

###### Default by other person

(13) An order of the court made under this section may be served on a person from whom the bankrupt is entitled to receive money and, in such case,

  * (_a_) the order binds the person to pay to the estate of the bankrupt the amount fixed by the order; and

  * (_b_) if the person fails to comply with the terms of the order, the court may, on the application of the trustee, order the person to pay the trustee the amount of money that the estate of the bankrupt would have received had the person complied with the terms of the order.

###### Application is a proceeding

(14) For the purposes of section 38, an application referred to in subsection (10) is deemed to be a proceeding for the benefit of the estate.

###### Property included for enforcement purposes

(15) For the purpose of this section, a requirement that a bankrupt pay an amount to the estate is enforceable against the bankrupt’s total income.

###### When obligation to pay ceases

(16) If an opposition to the automatic discharge of a bankrupt individual who is required to pay an amount to the estate is filed, the bankrupt’s obligation under this section ceases on the day on which the bankrupt would have been automatically discharged had the opposition not been filed, but nothing in this subsection precludes the court from determining that the bankrupt is required to pay to the estate an amount that the court considers appropriate.
