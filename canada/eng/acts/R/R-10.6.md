(2) Notwithstanding anything in this Part, payment of the pension of which any such pensioner was in receipt prior to his re-engagement as aforesaid shall, upon his final discharge from the Force, be immediately resumed; but the Governor in Council may, in his discretion, increase the amount of such pension by an amount equal to one-fiftieth of the annual pay and allowances of which such pensioner was in receipt at the time of his final discharge from the Force for each year or, save as otherwise provided by subsection (3), portion of a year of his service during the period of his re-engagement as aforesaid.

###### Computation

(3) In determining the period of service of a pensioner under re-engagement as aforesaid for the purposes of subsection (2), service of six months or more but of less than one year shall be counted as one-half of a year’s service, but service of less than six months shall not count for the purposes of any increase of pension; and where in the case of any pensioner no allowances for the rank held by him during re-engagement as aforesaid are prescribed for pension purposes, the Minister may recommend that such amount by way of allowances as may in his opinion be considered fair and just in the circumstances of the case be taken into account for the purpose of computing an increase of the pension of such pensioner under subsection (2).

###### “Pensioner”

(4) In this section “pensioner” means any constable who, prior to his re-engagement for service in the Force, was in receipt of a pension granted to him under this Act.
