An Act respecting the Rouge National Urban Park

###### Preamble

Whereas the Rouge Valley contains some of the last remnants of the Carolinian forest in Canada, significant geological features and a combination of diverse habitats linking Lake Ontario to the Oak Ridges Moraine;

Whereas the foresight, dedication and engagement of community visionaries and various levels of government have laid the foundation for the creation of a park in the Rouge Valley, an area that is rich in natural and cultural resources and is readily accessible to the population of Canada’s largest metropolitan area;

Whereas there is a unique opportunity to connect Canadians with the natural and cultural heritage of the Rouge Valley and with the history of its early Aboriginal inhabitants and others who shaped its landscapes;

And whereas Parliament wishes

to protect natural ecosystems and maintain native wildlife in the Rouge Valley,

to provide meaningful opportunities for Canadians to experience and enjoy the diverse landscapes of the Rouge Valley,

to engage local communities and businesses, Aboriginal organizations and youth, as well as other Canadians, to become stewards and ambassadors of the park,

to provide a wide range of recreational, interpretive, volunteer and learning activities to attract a diverse urban population to the park,

to enable youth and other visitors to connect with nature in an urban setting,

to protect the cultural landscapes of the park and identify its heritage values to facilitate an understanding and appreciation of the history of the region,

to encourage sustainable farming practices to support the preservation of agricultural lands in the park and celebrate the agricultural heritage of the region, and

to promote the park as a place of discovery, enjoyment and learning, and as a gateway to all of Canada’s national protected heritage areas;

Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:

###### Continuing offences

(2) If an offence is committed or continued on more than one day, it constitutes a separate offence for each day on which it is committed or continued.

###### Deeming — second and subsequent offence

(3) For the purposes of section 33, a conviction for a particular offence under this Act is deemed to be a conviction for a second or subsequent offence if the court is satisfied that the offender has been previously convicted of a substantially similar offence under federal or provincial legislation that relates to environmental or wildlife protection or conservation or to the protection of natural, cultural, historical or archaeological resources.

###### Limitation

(4) For the purposes of subsection (3), only previous convictions on indictment or on summary conviction, or under any similar procedure under any Act of the legislature of a province, are to be considered as previous convictions.

###### Fundamental purpose of sentencing

**37.** The fundamental purpose of sentencing for offences under this Act is to contribute to respect for the law establishing and protecting the Park through the imposition of just sanctions that have as their objectives

  * (_a_) to deter the offender and any other person from committing offences under this Act;

  * (_b_) to denounce unlawful conduct that damages or creates a risk of damage to the Park; and

  * (_c_) to restore resources in the Park.

###### Sentencing principles

**38.** (1) In addition to the principles and factors that the court is otherwise required to consider, including those set out in sections 718.1 to 718.21 of the [Criminal Code](/canada/eng/acts/C/C-46.md), the court must consider the following principles when sentencing a person who is convicted of an offence under this Act:

  * (_a_) the amount of the fine should be increased to account for every aggravating factor associated with the offence, including the aggravating factors set out in subsection (2); and

  * (_b_) the amount of the fine should reflect the gravity of each aggravating factor associated with the offence.

###### Aggravating factors

(2) The aggravating factors are the following:

  * (_a_) the offence caused damage or risk of damage to resources in the Park;

  * (_b_) the offence caused damage or risk of damage to any unique, rare, particularly important or vulnerable resources in the Park;

  * (_c_) the damage caused by the offence is extensive, persistent or irreparable;

  * (_d_) the offender committed the offence intentionally or recklessly;

  * (_e_) by committing the offence or failing to take action to prevent its commission, the offender increased their revenue or decreased their costs or intended to increase their revenue or decrease their costs;

  * (_f_) the offender committed the offence despite having been warned by the superintendent, a park warden or an enforcement officer of the circumstances that subsequently became the subject of the offence;

  * (_g_) the offender has a history of non-compliance with federal or provincial legislation that relates to environmental or wildlife protection or conservation or to the protection of natural, cultural, historical or archaeological resources; and

  * (_h_) after the commission of the offence, the offender

    * (i) attempted to conceal its commission,

    * (ii) failed to take prompt action to prevent, mitigate or remediate its effects, or

    * (iii) failed to take prompt action to reduce the risk of committing similar offences in the future.

###### Absence of aggravating factor

(3) The absence of an aggravating factor set out in subsection (2) is not a mitigating factor.

Meaning of “damage”

(4) For the purposes of paragraphs (2)(_a_) to (_c_), “damage” includes loss of use value and non-use value.

###### Reasons

(5) If the court is satisfied of the existence of one or more of the aggravating factors set out in subsection (2) but decides not to increase the amount of the fine because of that factor, it must give reasons for that decision.

###### Relief from minimum fine

**39.** The court may impose a fine that is less than the minimum amount provided for in section 33 if it is satisfied, on the basis of evidence submitted to the court, that the minimum fine would cause undue financial hardship. The court must provide reasons if it imposes a fine that is less than the minimum amount provided for in that section.

###### Additional fine

**40.** If a person is convicted of an offence under this Act and the court is satisfied that, as a result of the commission of the offence, the person acquired any property, benefit or advantage, the court must order the person to pay an additional fine in an amount of money equal to the court’s estimation of the value of that property, benefit or advantage. The additional fine may exceed the maximum amount of any fine that may otherwise be imposed under this Act.

###### Notice to shareholders

**41.** If a corporation that has shareholders is convicted of an offence under this Act, the court must make an order directing the corporation to notify its shareholders, in the manner and within the time directed by the court, of the facts relating to the commission of the offence and of the details of the punishment imposed.

###### Liability of directors, officers, etc., of corporations

**42.** (1) If a corporation commits an offence under this Act, any director, officer, agent or mandatary of the corporation who directed, authorized, assented to, acquiesced in or participated in the commission of the offence is a party to and guilty of the offence and is liable on conviction to the penalty provided for by this Act for an individual in respect of the offence committed by the corporation, whether or not the corporation has been prosecuted or convicted.

###### Duties of directors and officers of corporations

(2) Every director and officer of a corporation must take all reasonable care to ensure that the corporation complies with

  * (_a_) this Act; and

  * (_b_) orders made by a court or the superintendent under this Act.

###### Forfeiture

**43.** (1) If a person is convicted of an offence, the court may, in addition to any punishment imposed, order that any seized thing, or any proceeds of its disposition, be forfeited to Her Majesty in right of Canada.

###### Return if no forfeiture ordered

(2) If the court does not order the forfeiture, the seized thing or the proceeds of its disposition must be returned or paid to its owner or the person lawfully entitled to it.

###### Retention or sale

(3) If a fine is imposed on a person convicted of an offence, any seized thing, or any proceeds of its disposition, may be retained until the fine is paid or the thing may be sold in satisfaction of the fine and the proceeds applied, in whole or in part, in payment of the fine.

**44.** Any seized thing that has been forfeited under this Act to Her Majesty in right of Canada or abandoned by its owner may be dealt with and disposed of as the Minister may direct.

###### Application of fines

**45.** (1) All fines received by the Receiver General in respect of the commission of an offence under this Act, other than fines collected under the [Contraventions Act](/canada/eng/acts/C/C-38.7.md), are to be credited to the Environmental Damages Fund, an account in the accounts of Canada, and used for purposes related to protecting, conserving or restoring the Park or for administering that Fund.

###### Recommendations of court

(2) The court imposing the fine may recommend to the Minister that all or a portion of the fine credited to the Environmental Damages Fund be paid to a person or organization specified by the court for a purpose referred to in subsection (1).

###### Orders of court
