(3) The amount of a proposed penalty is, in each case, to be determined taking into account the following matters:

  * (_a_) the degree of intention or negligence on the part of the person who committed the violation;

  * (_b_) the harm done by the violation;

  * (_c_) the person’s history of prior violations or convictions under this Act during the five-year period immediately before the violation;

  * (_d_) any prescribed criteria; and

  * (_e_) any other relevant matter.

## Determination of Responsibility and Penalty

### Payment of Penalty

###### Payment

**26.** If the person pays the penalty proposed in the notice of violation, the person is considered to have committed the violation and proceedings in respect of it are ended.

### Making Representations

###### Making of representations

**27.** (1) If the person alleged to have committed a violation makes representations, the enforcement officer shall either

  * (_a_) enter into a compliance agreement with the person on behalf of the Minister; or

  * (_b_) decide on a balance of probabilities whether the person committed the violation and, if so, impose the penalty proposed, a lesser penalty or no penalty, taking into account the matters mentioned in subsection 25(3).

The enforcement officer shall cause notice of any decision made under paragraph (_b_) to be issued and served on the person together with notice of the person’s right of appeal under subsection 29(1).

###### Compliance agreements

(2) In the course of the making of representations, an enforcement officer may, on behalf of the Minister, enter into a compliance agreement with the person alleged to have committed a violation on any terms that the officer considers satisfactory. The terms

  * (_a_) must provide for payment by the person to the Receiver General of a specified amount not greater than the penalty proposed in the notice of violation if the person does not comply with the agreement; and

  * (_b_) may provide for the giving of reasonable security, in a form and an amount that the officer considers satisfactory, for the person’s performance of the agreement.

###### Agreement ends proceedings

(3) Entry into a compliance agreement ends the violation proceedings and precludes any further violation or offence proceedings in relation to the act or omission in question.

###### If agreement not complied with

(4) The Minister may issue and serve a notice of default on a person who has entered into a compliance agreement but has not complied with it. On service of the notice, the person is liable to pay without delay the amount provided for in the agreement, failing which, the Minister may realize or enforce any security for the person’s performance of the agreement.

### Responsibility

###### Failure to act

**28.** A person who neither pays the penalty nor makes representations in accordance with the notice of violation is considered to have committed the violation, and the enforcement officer shall impose the penalty proposed and notify the person of it.

## Appeal to Minister

###### Right of appeal

**29.** (1) A person served with notice of a decision made under paragraph 27(1)(_b_) may, within 30 days after the notice is served, or within any longer period that the Minister allows, appeal the decision to the Minister.

###### Powers of Minister

(2) On an appeal, the Minister may confirm, set aside or vary the decision of the enforcement officer.

## Rules about Violations

###### Vicarious liability — acts of employees, agents and mandataries

**30.** A person is liable for a violation that is committed by the person’s employee acting in the course of the employment or the person’s agent or mandatary acting within the scope of their authority, whether or not the employee, agent or mandatary who actually committed the violation is identified or proceeded against.

###### Due diligence

**31.** Due diligence is a defence in a proceeding in relation to a violation.

###### Continuing violation

**32.** A violation that is committed or continued on more than one day constitutes a separate violation for each day on which it is committed or continued.

###### Limitation period

**33.** Any proceedings in respect of a violation may be instituted at any time within, but not later than, two years after the time when the subject-matter of the proceedings arose.

###### Violation or offence

**34.** (1) If it is possible to proceed with any act or omission as a violation and it is also possible to proceed with it as an offence, proceeding in one manner precludes proceeding in the other.

###### Violations not offences

(2) For greater certainty, a violation is not an offence and, accordingly, section 126 of the [Criminal Code](/canada/eng/acts/C/C-46.md) does not apply in respect of one.

###### Admissibility of documents

**35.** In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a document that appears to be a notice issued under subsection 25(1) or 27(1) or (4) or given under section 28 or a certificate issued under subsection 37(1) is presumed to be authentic and is proof of its contents in any proceeding in respect of a violation or a prosecution for an offence.

## Recovery of Penalties and Amounts

###### Debts to Her Majesty

**36.** (1) A penalty imposed under this Act and an amount referred to in subsection 27(4) each constitute a debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada and may be recovered in the Federal Court or any other court of competent jurisdiction.

###### Time limit

(2) No proceedings to recover such a debt may be commenced later than seven years after the debt became payable.

###### Proceeds payable to Receiver General

(3) Each such debt is payable to the Receiver General.

###### Certificate

**37.** (1) The Minister may issue a certificate certifying the unpaid amount of any debt referred to in subsection 36(1).

###### Registration in Federal Court

(2) Registration in the Federal Court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction of a certificate issued under subsection (1) has the same effect as a judgment of that Court for a debt of the amount specified in the certificate and all related registration costs.

## OFFENCES

###### Contravention — section 5, 13 or 14 or subsection 16(1)

**38.** (1) Every person who contravenes section 5 or subsection 16(1) or an order made under section 13 or 14 is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction

###### Jurisdiction — contravention outside Canada

**39.** (1) If a person is alleged to have committed an act or omission that is a contravention of section 5 because of the application of section 6, proceedings in relation to that contravention may, whether or not the person is in Canada, be commenced in any territorial division in Canada, and the person may be tried and punished in respect of that offence in the same manner as if it had been committed in that territorial division.

###### Appearance of accused at trial

(2) The provisions of the [Criminal Code](/canada/eng/acts/C/C-46.md), including their exceptions, relating to requirements that an accused appear at and be present during proceedings apply in respect of proceedings commenced in a territorial division under subsection (1).

###### Offence dealt with outside Canada

(3) If a person is alleged to have committed an act or omission referred to in subsection (1) and the person has been dealt with outside Canada for the contravention in a manner that, if the person had been dealt with in Canada for the contravention in that manner, would allow the person to plead _autrefois acquit_, _autrefois convict_ or pardon, the person is deemed to have been so dealt with in Canada.

###### Liability of officers, directors, agents or mandataries

**40.** If a corporation commits an offence under this Act, any officer, director, agent or mandatary of the corporation who directed, authorized, assented to, acquiesced in or participated in the commission of the offence is a party to and guilty of the offence and is liable to the punishment provided for the offence, whether or not the corporation has been prosecuted or convicted.

###### Offences by employees, agents or mandataries

**41.** In a prosecution for an offence under this Act, it is sufficient proof of the offence to establish that it was committed by an employee, an agent or a mandatary of the accused, whether or not the employee, agent or mandatary is identified or has been prosecuted for the offence.

###### Due diligence

**42.** (1) Due diligence is a defence in a prosecution for an offence under this Act.

###### Section 126 of [Criminal Code](/canada/eng/acts/C/C-46.md)

###### Limitation period

**44.** Any proceedings by way of summary conviction in respect of an offence under this Act may be instituted at any time within, but not later than, two years after the time when the subject-matter of the proceedings arose.

###### Injunctions

**45.** If a court of competent jurisdiction — including the Federal Court — is satisfied, on application by the Minister, that a contravention of section 5 is being or is likely to be committed, the court may grant an injunction, subject to any conditions that the court considers appropriate, ordering any person to cease or refrain from any activity related to that contravention, or ordering the person to take any measure that a licensee could, under this Act, be required to take.
