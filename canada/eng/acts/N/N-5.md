However, the court martial is not required to make the order if it is satisfied that the person has established that the impact of such an order on their privacy and security of the person would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest in the protection of society and the proper administration of military justice, to be achieved through the early detection, arrest and conviction of offenders.

###### Order — persons found not responsible and secondary designated offences

(3) A court martial may, on application by the prosecutor and if it is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the administration of military justice to do so, make such an order in the prescribed form in relation to

  * (_a_) a person who is found not responsible on account of mental disorder for an offence committed at any time, including before June 30, 2000, if that offence is a designated offence when the finding is made; or

  * (_b_) a person who is found guilty of an offence committed at any time, including before June 30, 2000, if that offence is a secondary designated offence when the person is sentenced.

In deciding whether to make the order, the court martial shall consider the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, any previous convictions by a service tribunal or civil court, any previous finding of not responsible on account of mental disorder for a designated offence and the impact such an order would have on the person’s privacy and security of the person and shall give reasons for the decision.

###### Order to offender

(4) When a court martial makes an order authorizing the taking of samples of bodily substances, it may make an order in the prescribed form to require the person to report at the place, day and time set out in the order and submit to the taking of the samples.
