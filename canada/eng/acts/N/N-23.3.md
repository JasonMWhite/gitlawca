An Act to give effect to the Nisga’a Final Agreement

###### Preamble

Whereas the reconciliation between the prior presence of aboriginal peoples and the assertion of sovereignty by the Crown is of significant social and economic importance to Canadians;

Whereas Canadian courts have stated that this reconciliation is best achieved through negotiation and agreement, rather than through litigation or conflict;

Whereas representatives of the Nisga’a Nation, Her Majesty in right of Canada and Her Majesty in right of British Columbia have negotiated the Nisga’a Final Agreement to achieve this reconciliation and to establish a new relationship among them;

Whereas the Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada;

Whereas the Nisga’a Final Agreement states that the Agreement does not alter the Constitution of Canada;

Whereas the Nisga’a Final Agreement states that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to Nisga’a Government in respect of all matters within its authority, bearing in mind the free and democratic nature of Nisga’a Government as set out in the Agreement;

And Whereas the enactment of federal legislation is required by the Nisga’a Final Agreement to give effect to the Agreement;

Now, Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
