###### General depreciation provisions

###### Idem

(2) Where a taxpayer acquired depreciable property before the beginning of the 1949 taxation year, for the purposes of section 13 of the amended Act and any regulations made under paragraph 20(1)(_a_) of that Act an amount equal to the total of

###### Deduction deemed depreciation

(5) An amount deducted under paragraph 5(1)(_u_) of the Income War Tax Act in respect of amounts of a capital nature shall, for the purpose of this section, be deemed to be depreciation taken into account in ascertaining the taxpayer’s income for the purpose of that Act or in ascertaining the taxpayer’s loss for the taxation year for which it was deducted.

## Special Transitional Rules

###### Income maintenance payments

**19.** (1) Notwithstanding section 9, paragraph 6(1)(_f_) of the amended Act does not apply in respect of amounts received by a taxpayer in a taxation year that were payable to the taxpayer in respect of the loss, in consequence of an event occurring before 1974, of all or any part of the taxpayer’s income from an office or employment, under a plan, described in that paragraph, that was established before June 19, 1971.

###### Depreciable property

**20.** (1) Where the capital cost to a taxpayer of any depreciable property acquired by the taxpayer before 1972 and owned by the taxpayer without interruption from December 31, 1971 until such time after 1971 as the taxpayer disposed of it is less than the fair market value of the property on valuation day and less than the proceeds of disposition thereof otherwise determined,

  * (_a_) for the purposes of section 13 of the amended Act, subdivision c of Division B of Part I of that Act and any regulations made under paragraph 20(1)(_a_) of that Act, the taxpayer’s proceeds of disposition of the property shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the total of its capital cost to the taxpayer and the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of disposition thereof otherwise determined exceed the fair market value of the property on valuation day,

  * (_b_) where the property has, by one or more transactions or events (other than the death of a taxpayer to which subsection 70(5) of the amended Act applies) between persons not dealing at arm’s length, become vested in another taxpayer

    * (i) for the purposes of the amended Act (other than, where paragraph 13(7)(_e_) of that Act applies in determining the capital cost to that other taxpayer of the property, for the purposes of paragraphs 8(1)(_j_) and (_p_) and sections 13 and 20 of that Act), that other taxpayer shall be deemed to have acquired the property at a capital cost equal to the proceeds deemed to have been received for the property by the person from whom that other taxpayer acquired the property, and

    * (ii) for the purposes of this subsection, that other taxpayer shall be deemed to have acquired the property before 1972 at a capital cost equal to the capital cost of the property to the taxpayer who actually owned the property at the end of 1971, and to have owned it without interruption from December 31, 1971 until such time after 1971 as that other taxpayer disposed of it, and

  * (_c_) where the disposition occurred because of an election under subsection 110.6(19) of the amended Act,

    * (i) for the purposes of that Act (other than paragraphs 8(1)(_j_) and (_p_) and sections 13 and 20 of that Act), the taxpayer is deemed to have reacquired the property at a capital cost equal to

      * (A) where the amount designated in respect of the property in the election did not exceed 110% of the fair market value of the property at the end of February 22, 1994, the taxpayer’s proceeds of disposition determined under paragraph (_a_) in respect of the disposition of the property that immediately preceded the reacquisition minus the amount, if any, by which the amount designated in respect of the property in the election exceeded that fair market value, and

      * (B) in any other case, the amount otherwise determined under subsection 110.6(19) of that Act to be the cost to the taxpayer of the property immediately after the reacquisition referred to in that subsection minus the amount by which the fair market value of the property on valuation day exceeded the capital cost of the property at the time it was last acquired before 1972, and

    * (ii) for the purposes of this subsection, the taxpayer’s capital cost of the property after the reacquisition shall be deemed to be equal to the taxpayer’s capital cost of the property before the reacquisition and the taxpayer shall be considered to have owned the property without interruption from December 31, 1971 until such time after February 22, 1994 as the taxpayer disposes of it.

###### Where depreciable property disposed of to spouse, trust or child

(1.1) Subsection (1) does not apply in any case where

  * (_a_) subsection 70(6) or 73(1) of the amended Act applies in respect of the disposition by a taxpayer of any depreciable property of a prescribed class to the spouse, common-law partner, trust or transferee, as the case may be, referred to therein, and

  * (_b_) subsection 70(9) of the amended Act applies in respect of the disposition by a taxpayer of any depreciable property of a prescribed class to a child referred to therein,

except that where the spouse, common-law partner, trust, transferee or child, as the case may be, subsequently disposes of the property at any time, subsection (1) applies as if the spouse, common-law partner, trust, transferee or child, as the case may be, had acquired the property before 1972 and owned it without interruption from December 31, 1971 until that time.

Extended meaning of “child”

(1.11) For the purposes of subsection (1.1), “child” of a taxpayer includes

  * (_a_) a child of the taxpayer’s child;

(1.2) Where, because of a transaction or an event in respect of which any of subsections 70(5), 85(1), (2) and (3), 87(2), section 88, subsections 97(2), 98(3) and (5) and 107(2) of the amended Act applies, a taxpayer has at any particular time after 1971 acquired any depreciable property of a prescribed class from a person who acquired the property before 1972 and owned it without interruption from December 31, 1971 until the particular time, for the purposes of subsection (1) the taxpayer shall be deemed to have acquired the property before 1972 and to have owned it without interruption from December 31, 1971 until such time after 1971 as the taxpayer disposed of it.

###### Transfers before 1972 not at arm’s length

(1.3) Without restricting the generality of section 18, where any depreciable property has been transferred before 1972 in circumstances such that subsection 20(4) of the former Act would, if that provision applied to transfers of property made in the 1972 taxation year, apply, paragraph 69(1)(_b_) of the amended Act does not apply to the transfer and subsection 20(4) of the former Act applies thereto.

###### Depreciable property received as dividend in kind

(1.4) The capital cost to a taxpayer, as of any particular time after 1971, of any depreciable property (other than depreciable property referred to in subsection (1.3) or deemed by subparagraph (1)(_b_)(ii) to have been acquired by the taxpayer before 1972) acquired by the taxpayer before 1972 as, on account of, in lieu of payment of or in satisfaction of, a dividend payable in kind (other than a stock dividend) in respect of a share owned by the taxpayer of the capital stock of a corporation, shall be deemed to be the fair market value of that property at the time the property was so received.

###### Recapture of capital cost allowances

(2) In determining a taxpayer’s income for a taxation year from farming or fishing, subsection 13(1) of the amended Act does not apply in respect of the disposition by the taxpayer of property acquired by the taxpayer before 1972 unless the taxpayer has elected to make a deduction for that or a preceding taxation year, in respect of the capital cost of property acquired by the taxpayer before 1972, under regulations made under paragraph 20(1)(_a_) of that Act other than a regulation providing solely for an allowance for computing income from farming or fishing.

exceeds the total of all amounts deducted under this paragraph in computing the persons income for preceding taxation years, and, for the purposes of section 3 of the amended Act, the amount so claimed shall be deemed to be a deduction permitted by subdivision e of Division B of Part I of that Act; and
