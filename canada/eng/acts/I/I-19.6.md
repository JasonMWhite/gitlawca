## SCHEDULE 1 - (Subsection 2(1)) - CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL INTERESTS IN MOBILE EQUIPMENT

THE STATES PARTIES TO THIS CONVENTION,

AWARE of the need to acquire and use mobile equipment of high value or particular economic significance and to facilitate the financing of the acquisition and use of such equipment in an efficient manner,

MINDFUL of the need to ensure that interests in such equipment are recognised and protected universally,

DESIRING to provide broad and mutual economic benefits for all interested parties,

BELIEVING that such rules must reflect the principles underlying asset-based financing and leasing and promote the autonomy of the parties necessary in these transactions,

CONSCIOUS of the need to establish a legal framework for international interests in such equipment and for that purpose to create an international registration system for their protection,

TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION the objectives and principles enunciated in existing Conventions relating to such equipment,

The International Interest

  * 1. This Convention provides for the constitution and effects of an international interest in certain categories of mobile equipment and associated rights.

  * 2. For the purposes of this Convention, an international interest in mobile equipment is an interest, constituted under Article 7, in a uniquely identifiable object of a category of such objects listed in paragraph 3 and designated in the Protocol:

    * (_a_) granted by the chargor under a security agreement;

    * (_b_) vested in a person who is the conditional seller under a title reservation agreement; or

    * (_c_) vested in a person who is the lessor under a leasing agreement.

An interest falling within sub-paragraph (_a_) does not also fall within sub-paragraph (_b_) or (_c_).

  * 3. The categories referred to in the preceding paragraphs are:

    * (_a_) airframes, aircraft engines and helicopters;

    * (_b_) railway rolling stock; and

    * (_c_) space assets.

  * 4. The applicable law determines whether an interest to which paragraph 2 applies falls within sub-paragraph (_a_), (_b_) or (_c_) of that paragraph.

  * 5. An international interest in an object extends to proceeds of that object.

### Article 3  
Sphere of Application

  * 1. This Convention applies when, at the time of the conclusion of the agreement creating or providing for the international interest, the debtor is situated in a Contracting State.

  * 2. The fact that the creditor is situated in a non-Contracting State does not affect the applicability of this Convention.

### Article 4  
Where Debtor Is Situated

  * 1. For the purposes of Article 3(1), the debtor is situated in any Contracting State:

    * (_a_) under the law of which it is incorporated or formed;

    * (_b_) where it has its registered office or statutory seat;

### Article 5  
Interpretation and Applicable Law

  * 1. In the interpretation of this Convention, regard is to be had to its purposes as set forth in the preamble, to its international character and to the need to promote uniformity and predictability in its application.

  * 2. Questions concerning matters governed by this Convention which are not expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the general principles on which it is based or, in the absence of such principles, in conformity with the applicable law.

  * 3. References to the applicable law are to the domestic rules of the law applicable by virtue of the rules of private international law of the forum State.

  * 4. Where a State comprises several territorial units, each of which has its own rules of law in respect of the matter to be decided, and where there is no indication of the relevant territorial unit, the law of that State decides which is the territorial unit whose rules shall govern. In the absence of any such rule, the law of the territorial unit with which the case is most closely connected shall apply.

### Article 6  
Relationship Between the Convention and the Protocol

  * 1. This Convention and the Protocol shall be read and interpreted together as a single instrument.

## CHAPTER II  
CONSTITUTION OF AN INTERNATIONAL INTEREST

### Article 7  
Formal Requirements

An interest is constituted as an international interest under this Convention where the agreement creating or providing for the interest:

  * (_a_) is in writing;

  * (_b_) relates to an object of which the chargor, conditional seller or lessor has power to dispose;

  * (_c_) enables the object to be identified in conformity with the Protocol; and

  * (_d_) in the case of a security agreement, enables the secured obligations to be determined, but without the need to state a sum or maximum sum secured.

## CHAPTER III  
DEFAULT REMEDIES

### Article 8  
Remedies of Chargee

  * 1. In the event of default as provided in Article 11, the chargee may, to the extent that the chargor has at any time so agreed and subject to any declaration that may be made by a Contracting State under Article 54, exercise any one or more of the following remedies:

    * (_a_) take possession or control of any object charged to it;

    * (_b_) sell or grant a lease of any such object;

    * (_c_) collect or receive any income or profits arising from the management or use of any such object.

  * 2. The chargee may alternatively apply for a court order authorising or directing any of the acts referred to in the preceding paragraph.

  * 3. Any remedy set out in sub-paragraph (_a_), (_b_) or (_c_) of paragraph 1 or by Article 13 shall be exercised in a commercially reasonable manner. A remedy shall be deemed to be exercised in a commercially reasonable manner where it is exercised in conformity with a provision of the security agreement except where such a provision is manifestly unreasonable.

  * 4. A chargee proposing to sell or grant a lease of an object under paragraph 1 shall give reasonable prior notice in writing of the proposed sale or lease to:

    * (_a_) interested persons specified in Article 1(_m_)(i) and (ii); and

    * (_b_) interested persons specified in Article 1(_m_)(iii) who have given notice of their rights to the chargee within a reasonable time prior to the sale or lease.

  * 5. Any sum collected or received by the chargee as a result of exercise of any of the remedies set out in paragraph 1 or 2 shall be applied towards discharge of the amount of the secured obligations.

  * 6. Where the sums collected or received by the chargee as a result of the exercise of any remedy set out in paragraph 1 or 2 exceed the amount secured by the security interest and any reasonable costs incurred in the exercise of any such remedy, then unless otherwise ordered by the court the chargee shall distribute the surplus among holders of subsequently ranking interests which have been registered or of which the chargee has been given notice, in order of priority, and pay any remaining balance to the chargor.

### Article 9  
Vesting of Object in Satisfaction; Redemption

  * 1. At any time after default as provided in Article 11, the chargee and all the interested persons may agree that ownership of (or any other interest of the chargor in) any object covered by the security interest shall vest in the chargee in or towards satisfaction of the secured obligations.

  * 2. The court may on the application of the chargee order that ownership of (or any other interest of the chargor in) any object covered by the security interest shall vest in the chargee in or towards satisfaction of the secured obligations.

  * 3. The court shall grant an application under the preceding paragraph only if the amount of the secured obligations to be satisfied by such vesting is commensurate with the value of the object after taking account of any payment to be made by the chargee to any of the interested persons.

  * 4. At any time after default as provided in Article 11 and before sale of the charged object or the making of an order under paragraph 2, the chargor or any interested person may discharge the security interest by paying in full the amount secured, subject to any lease granted by the chargee under Article 8(1)(_b_) or ordered under Article 8(2). Where, after such default, the payment of the amount secured is made in full by an interested person other than the debtor, that person is subrogated to the rights of the chargee.

  * 5. Ownership or any other interest of the chargor passing on a sale under Article 8(1)(_b_) or passing under paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article is free from any other interest over which the chargee’s security interest has priority under the provisions of Article 29.

### Article 10  
Remedies of Conditional Seller or Lessor

In the event of default under a title reservation agreement or under a leasing agreement as provided in Article 11, the conditional seller or the lessor, as the case may be, may:

  * (_a_) subject to any declaration that may be made by a Contracting State under Article 54, terminate the agreement and take possession or control of any object to which the agreement relates; or

  * (_b_) apply for a court order authorising or directing either of these acts.

### Article 11  
Meaning of Default

  * 1. The debtor and the creditor may at any time agree in writing as to the events that constitute a default or otherwise give rise to the rights and remedies specified in Articles 8 to 10 and 13.

  * 2. Where the debtor and the creditor have not so agreed, “default” for the purposes of Articles 8 to 10 and 13 means a default which substantially deprives the creditor of what it is entitled to expect under the agreement.

### Article 12  
Additional Remedies

Any additional remedies permitted by the applicable law, including any remedies agreed upon by the parties, may be exercised to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the mandatory provisions of this Chapter as set out in Article 15.

### Article 13  
Relief Pending Final Determination

  * 1. Subject to any declaration that it may make under Article 55, a Contracting State shall ensure that a creditor who adduces evidence of default by the debtor may, pending final determination of its claim and to the extent that the debtor has at any time so agreed, obtain from a court speedy relief in the form of such one or more of the following orders as the creditor requests:

    * (_a_) preservation of the object and its value;

    * (_b_) possession, control or custody of the object;

    * (_c_) immobilisation of the object; and

    * (_d_) lease or, except where covered by sub-paragraphs (_a_) to (_c_), management of the object and the income therefrom.

  * 2. In making any order under the preceding paragraph, the court may impose such terms as it considers necessary to protect the interested persons in the event that the creditor:

    * (_a_) in implementing any order granting such relief, fails to perform any of its obligations to the debtor under this Convention or the Protocol; or

    * (_b_) fails to establish its claim, wholly or in part, on the final determination of that claim.

  * 3. Before making any order under paragraph 1, the court may require notice of the request to be given to any of the interested persons.

  * 4. Nothing in this Article affects the application of Article 8(3) or limits the availability of forms of interim relief other than those set out in paragraph 1.

### Article 14  
Procedural Requirements

Subject to Article 54(2), any remedy provided by this Chapter shall be exercised in conformity with the procedure prescribed by the law of the place where the remedy is to be exercised.

### Article 15  
Derogation

In their relations with each other, any two or more of the parties referred to in this Chapter may at any time, by agreement in writing, derogate from or vary the effect of any of the preceding provisions of this Chapter except Articles 8(3) to (6), 9(3) and (4), 13(2) and 14.

    * (_a_) the debtor has been given notice of the assignment in writing by or with the authority of the assignor; and

    * (_b_) the notice identifies the associated rights.

  * 2. Irrespective of any other ground on which payment or performance by the debtor discharges the latter from liability, payment or performance shall be effective for this purpose if made in accordance with the preceding paragraph.

  * 1. Where there are competing assignments of associated rights and at least one of the assignments includes the related international interest and is registered, the provisions of Article 29 apply as if the references to a registered interest were references to an assignment of the associated rights and the related registered interest and as if references to a registered or unregistered interest were references to a registered or unregistered assignment.

  * 2. Article 30 applies to an assignment of associated rights as if the references to an international interest were references to an assignment of the associated rights and the related international interest.

### Article 36  
Assignee’s Priority with Respect to Associated Rights

  * 1. The assignee of associated rights and the related international interest whose assignment has been registered only has priority under Article 35(1) over another assignee of the associated rights:

## CHAPTER III  
DEFAULT REMEDIES

### Article 12  
Remedies of Chargee

  * 1. In the event of default as provided in Article 17, the chargee may, to the extent that the chargor has at any time so agreed and subject to any declaration that may be made by a Contracting State under Article 70, exercise any one or more of the following remedies:

    * (_a_) take possession or control of any aircraft object charged to it;

    * (_b_) sell or grant a lease of any such aircraft object;

    * (_c_) collect or receive any income or profits arising from the management or use of any such aircraft object.

  * 2. The chargee may alternatively apply for a court order authorising or directing any of the acts referred to in the preceding paragraph.

  * 3. A chargee proposing to sell or grant a lease of an aircraft object under paragraph 1 shall give reasonable prior notice in writing of the proposed sale or lease to:

    * (_a_) interested persons specified in Article 1(_z_)(i) and (ii); and

    * (_b_) interested persons specified in Article 1(_z_)(iii) who have given notice of their rights to the chargee within a reasonable time prior to the sale or lease.

  * 4. A chargee giving ten or more working days’ prior written notice of a proposed sale or lease to interested persons shall be deemed to satisfy the requirement of providing “reasonable prior notice” specified in the preceding paragraph. The foregoing shall not prevent a chargee and a chargor or a guarantor from agreeing to a longer period of prior notice.

  * 5. Any sum collected or received by the chargee as a result of exercise of any of the remedies set out in paragraph 1 or 2 shall be applied towards discharge of the amount of the secured obligations.

  * 6. Where the sums collected or received by the chargee as a result of the exercise of any remedy set out in paragraph 1 or 2 exceed the amount secured by the security interest and any reasonable costs incurred in the exercise of any such remedy, then unless otherwise ordered by the court the chargee shall distribute the surplus among holders of subsequently ranking interests which have been registered or of which the chargee has been given notice, in order of priority, and pay any remaining balance to the chargor.

### Article 13  
Vesting of Aircraft Object in Satisfaction; Redemption

  * 1. At any time after default as provided in Article 17, the chargee and all the interested persons may agree that ownership of (or any other interest of the chargor in) any aircraft object covered by the security interest shall vest in the chargee in or towards satisfaction of the secured obligations.

  * 2. The court may on the application of the chargee order that ownership of (or any other interest of the chargor in) any aircraft object covered by the security interest shall vest in the chargee in or towards satisfaction of the secured obligations.

  * 3. The court shall grant an application under the preceding paragraph only if the amount of the secured obligations to be satisfied by such vesting is commensurate with the value of the aircraft object after taking account of any payment to be made by the chargee to any of the interested persons.

  * 4. At any time after default as provided in Article 17 and before sale of the charged aircraft object or the making of an order under paragraph 2, the chargor or any interested person may discharge the security interest by paying in full the amount secured, subject to any lease granted by the chargee under Article 12(1)(_b_) or ordered under Article 12(2). Where, after such default, the payment of the amount secured is made in full by an interested person other than the debtor, that person is subrogated to the rights of the chargee.

  * 5. Ownership or any other interest of the chargor passing on a sale under Article 12(1)(_b_) or passing under paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article is free from any other interest over which the chargee’s security interest has priority under the provisions of Article 42.

### Article 14

  * 3. The registry authority in a Contracting State shall, subject to any applicable safety laws and regulations, honour a request for de-registration and export if:

    * (_a_) the request is properly submitted by the authorised party under a recorded irrevocable de-registration and export request authorisation; and

    * (_b_) the authorised party certifies to the registry authority, if required by that authority, that all registered interests ranking in priority to that of the creditor in whose favour the authorisation has been issued have been discharged or that the holders of such interests have consented to the de-registration and export.

    * (_b_) the holder of any interest to which the debtor’s right or interest is subject pursuant to Article 42(5) or, in the capacity of buyer, Article 42(4) of this Convention, but only to the extent, if any, that such holder has agreed.

### Article 19  
Standard for Exercising Remedies

### Article 20  
Relief Pending Final Determination

  * 1. Subject to any declaration that it may make under Article 71(2), a Contracting State shall ensure that a creditor who adduces evidence of default by the debtor may, pending final determination of its claim and to the extent that the debtor has at any time so agreed, obtain from a court speedy relief in the form of such one or more of the following orders as the creditor requests:

  * 3. Ownership or any other interest of the debtor passing on a sale under sub-paragraph (_e_) of paragraph 1 of this Article is free from any other interest over which the creditor’s international interest has priority under the provisions of Article 42 of this Convention.

  * 4. In making any order under paragraph 1 of this Article, the court may impose such terms as it considers necessary to protect the interested persons in the event that the creditor:

    * (_a_) in implementing any order granting such relief, fails to perform any of its obligations to the debtor under this Convention; or

    * (_b_) fails to establish its claim, wholly or in part, on the final determination of that claim.

  * 5. The creditor and the debtor or any other interested person may agree in writing to exclude the application of the preceding paragraph.

  * 6. Before making any order under paragraph 1, the court may require notice of the request to be given to any of the interested persons.

  * 7. With regard to the remedies in Article 15(1):

    * (_a_) they shall be made available by the registry authority and other administrative authorities, as applicable, in a Contracting State no later than five working days after the creditor notifies such authorities that the relief specified in Article 15(1) is granted or, in the case of relief granted by a foreign court, recognised by a court of that Contracting State, and that the creditor is entitled to procure those remedies in accordance with this Convention; and

    * (_b_) the applicable authorities shall expeditiously co-operate with and assist the creditor in the exercise of such remedies in conformity with the applicable aviation safety laws and regulations.

  * 8. Nothing in the preceding paragraphs affects the application of Article 19 or limits the availability of forms of interim relief other than those set out in paragraph 1.

## CHAPTER VIII  
EFFECTS OF AN INTERNATIONAL INTEREST AS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES

### Article 42  
Priority of Competing Interests

  * 1. A registered interest has priority over any other interest subsequently registered and over an unregistered interest.

  * 2. The priority of the first-mentioned interest under the preceding paragraph applies:

    * (_a_) even if the first-mentioned interest was acquired or registered with actual knowledge of the other interest; and

    * (_b_) even as regards value given by the holder of the first-mentioned interest with such knowledge.

  * 3. A buyer of an aircraft object under a registered sale acquires its interest in that object free from an interest subsequently registered and from an unregistered interest, even if the buyer has actual knowledge of the unregistered interest.

  * 4. A buyer of an aircraft object acquires its interest in that object subject to an interest registered at the time of its acquisition.

  * 5. A conditional buyer or lessee acquires its interest in or right over that object:

    * (_a_) subject to an interest registered prior to the registration of the international interest held by its conditional seller or lessor; and

    * (_b_) free from an interest not so registered at that time even if it has actual knowledge of that interest.

  * 6. The priority of competing interests or rights under this Article may be varied by agreement between the holders of those interests, but an assignee of a subordinated interest is not bound by an agreement to subordinate that interest unless at the time of the assignment a subordination had been registered relating to that agreement.

  * 7. Any priority given by this Article to an interest in an aircraft object extends to proceeds.

  * 8. This Convention:

    * (_a_) does not affect the rights of a person in an item, other than an aircraft object, held prior to its installation on an aircraft object if under the applicable law those rights continue to exist after the installation; and

    * (_b_) does not prevent the creation of rights in an item, other than an aircraft object, which has previously been installed on an aircraft object where under the applicable law those rights are created.

  * 9. Ownership of or another right or interest in an aircraft engine shall not be affected by its installation on or removal from an aircraft.

### Article 43  
Effects of Insolvency

  * 1. In insolvency proceedings against the debtor an international interest is effective if prior to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings that interest was registered in conformity with this Convention.

  * 2. Nothing in this Article impairs the effectiveness of an international interest in the insolvency proceedings where that interest is effective under the applicable law.

  * 3. Nothing in this Article affects any rules of law applicable in insolvency proceedings relating to the avoidance of a transaction as a preference or a transfer in fraud of creditors or any rules of procedure relating to the enforcement of rights to property which is under the control or supervision of the insolvency administrator.

## CHAPTER IX  
ASSIGNMENTS OF ASSOCIATED RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL INTERESTS; RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION

### Article 44  
Effects of Assignment

  * 1. Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, an assignment of associated rights made in conformity with Article 45 also transfers to the assignee:

    * (_a_) the related international interest; and

    * (_b_) all the interests and priorities of the assignor under this Convention.

  * 2. Nothing in this Convention prevents a partial assignment of the assignor’s associated rights. In the case of such a partial assignment the assignor and assignee may agree as to their respective rights concerning the related international interest assigned under the preceding paragraph but not so as adversely to affect the debtor without its consent.

  * 3. Subject to paragraph 4, the applicable law shall determine the defences and rights of set-off available to the debtor against the assignee.

  * 4. The debtor may at any time by agreement in writing waive all or any of the defences and rights of set-off referred to in the preceding paragraph other than defences arising from fraudulent acts on the part of the assignee.

  * 5. In the case of an assignment by way of security, the assigned associated rights revest in the assignor, to the extent that they are still subsisting, when the obligations secured by the assignment have been discharged.

### Article 45  
Formal Requirements of Assignment

  * 1. An assignment of associated rights transfers the related international interest only if it:

    * (_a_) is in writing;

    * (_b_) enables the associated rights to be identified under the contract from which they arise; and

  * (_a_) to the secured obligation and the security interest were references to the obligation secured by the assignment of the associated rights and the related international interest and the security interest created by that assignment;

  * (_b_) to the chargee or creditor and chargor or debtor were references to the assignee and assignor;

  * 1. The assignee of associated rights and the related international interest whose assignment has been registered only has priority under Article 48(1) over another assignee of the associated rights:

    * (_a_) if the contract under which the associated rights arise states that they are secured by or associated with the object; and

    * (_b_) to the extent that the associated rights are related to an aircraft object.

  * 2. For the purpose of sub-paragraph (_b_) of the preceding paragraph, associated rights are related to an aircraft object only to the extent that they consist of rights to payment or performance that relate to:

    * (_a_) a sum advanced and utilised for the purchase of the aircraft object;

    * (_b_) a sum advanced and utilised for the purchase of another aircraft object in which the assignor held another international interest if the assignor transferred that interest to the assignee and the assignment has been registered;

    * (_c_) the price payable for the aircraft object;

    * (_d_) the rentals payable in respect of the aircraft object; or
