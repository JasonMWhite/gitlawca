  * (_a_) the selection and sponsorship of, and the acquisition of status by, foreign nationals under this Act; and

  * (_b_) regulations governing those matters, including regulations respecting the examination in Canada of applications to become a permanent resident, or respecting the foreign nationals who may be selected on the basis of an investment in Canada.

###### Inadmissibility not limited

  * (_a_) the foreign national, unless inadmissible under this Act, shall be granted permanent resident status if the foreign national meets the province’s selection criteria;

  * (_b_) the foreign national shall not be granted permanent resident status if the foreign national does not meet the province’s selection criteria;
