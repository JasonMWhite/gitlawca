the Minister may, by notice in writing, require the institution or person, as the case may be, to pay in whole or in part to the Receiver General on account of the debtor’s liability under this Act the money that would otherwise be so loaned, advanced or paid.

###### Amounts payable to secured creditor

(3) Despite any provision of this or any other Act (other than the [Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act](/canada/eng/acts/B/B-3.md)), any enactment of a province or any law, if the Minister has knowledge or suspects that a person is or will become, within 90 days, liable to make a payment to a debtor or to a secured creditor who has a right to receive the payment that, but for a security interest in favour of the secured creditor, would be payable to the debtor, the Minister may, by a notice in writing, require the person to pay without delay, if the moneys are immediately payable, and in any other case, as and when the moneys become payable, the moneys otherwise payable to the debtor or the secured creditor in whole or in part to the Receiver General on account of the debtor’s liability under this Act. On receipt of that letter by the person, the amount of those moneys that is required by that letter to be paid to the Receiver General becomes, despite any security interest in those moneys, the property of Her Majesty to the extent of that liability as assessed by the Minister and shall be paid to the Receiver General in priority to any such security interest.

###### Effect of receipt

(4) A receipt issued by the Minister for money paid as required under this section is a good and sufficient discharge of the original liability to the extent of the payment.

###### Effect of requirement

(5) If the Minister has, under this section, required a person to pay to the Receiver General on account of the liability under this Act of a debtor money otherwise payable by the person to the debtor as interest, rent, remuneration, a dividend, an annuity or other periodic payment, the requirement applies to all such payments to be made by the person to the debtor until the liability under this Act is satisfied, and operates to require payments to the Receiver General out of each such payment of any amount that is stipulated by the Minister in a notice in writing.

###### Failure to comply

(6) Every person who fails to comply with a requirement under subsection (1) or (5) is liable to pay to Her Majesty an amount equal to the amount that the person was required under that subsection to pay to the Receiver General.

###### Other failures to comply

(7) Every institution or person that fails to comply with a requirement under subsection (2) with respect to money to be loaned, advanced or paid is liable to pay to Her Majesty an amount equal to the lesser of

  * (_a_) the total of money so loaned, advanced or paid, and

  * (_b_) the amount that the institution or person was required under that subsection to pay to the Receiver General.

###### Assessment

(8) The Minister may assess any person for any amount payable under this section by the person to the Receiver General and, if the Minister sends a notice of assessment, sections 39 to 52 apply with any modifications that the circumstances require.

###### Time limit

(9) An assessment of an amount payable under this section by a person to the Receiver General shall not be made more than four years after the notice from the Minister requiring the payment was received by the person.

###### Effect of payment as required

(10) If an amount that would otherwise have been advanced, loaned or paid to or on behalf of a debtor is paid by a person to the Receiver General in accordance with a notice from the Minister issued under this section or with an assessment under subsection (8), the person is deemed for all purposes to have advanced, loaned or paid the amount to or on behalf of the debtor.

###### Recovery by deduction or set-off

**76.** If a person is indebted to Her Majesty under this Act, the Minister may require the retention by way of deduction or set-off of any amount that the Minister may specify out of any amount that may be or become payable to that person by Her Majesty.

###### Acquisition of debtor’s property

**77.** For the purpose of collecting debts owed by a person to Her Majesty under this Act, the Minister may purchase or otherwise acquire any interest in the person’s property that the Minister is given a right to acquire in legal proceedings or under a court order or that is offered for sale or redemption, and may dispose of any interest so acquired in any manner that the Minister considers reasonable.

###### Money seized from debtor

**78.** (1) If the Minister has knowledge or suspects that a person is holding money that was seized by a police officer in the course of administering or enforcing the criminal law of Canada from another person who is liable to pay any amount under this Act (in this section referred to as the “debtor”) and that is restorable to the debtor, the Minister may in writing require the person to turn over the money otherwise restorable to the debtor, in whole or in part, to the Receiver General on account of the debtor’s liability under this Act.

###### Receipt of Minister

(2) A receipt issued by the Minister for money turned over is a good and sufficient discharge of the requirement to restore the money to the debtor to the extent of the amount so turned over.

###### Seizure if failure to pay

**79.** (1) If a person fails to pay an amount as required under this Act, the Minister may in writing give 30 days notice to the person, addressed to their latest known address, of the Minister’s intention to direct that the person’s things be seized and disposed of. If the person fails to make the payment before the expiry of the 30 days, the Minister may issue a certificate of the failure and direct that the person’s things be seized.

###### Disposition

(2) Things that have been seized under subsection (1) shall be kept for 10 days at the expense and risk of the owner. If the owner does not pay the amount due together with all expenses within the 10 days, the Minister may dispose of the things in a manner the Minister considers appropriate in the circumstances.

###### Proceeds of disposition

(3) Any surplus resulting from a disposition, after deduction of the amount owing and all expenses, shall be paid or returned to the owner of the things seized.

###### Exemptions from seizure

(4) Anything of any person in default that would be exempt from seizure under a writ of execution issued by a superior court of the province in which the seizure is made is exempt from seizure under this section.

###### Person leaving Canada or defaulting

**80.** (1) If the Minister suspects that a person has left or is about to leave Canada, the Minister may, before the day otherwise fixed for payment, by notice to the person served personally or sent by registered or certified mail addressed to their latest known address, demand payment of any amount for which the person is liable under this Act or would be so liable if the time for payment had arrived, and the amount shall be paid without delay despite any other provision of this Act.

###### Seizure

(2) If a person fails to pay an amount required under subsection (1), the Minister may direct that things of the person be seized, and subsections 79(2) to (4) apply, with any modifications that the circumstances require.

###### Liability of directors

**81.** (1) If a corporation fails to pay any amount as and when required under this Act, the directors of the corporation at the time it was required to pay it are jointly and severally or solidarily liable, together with the corporation, to pay it and any interest that is payable on it under this Act.

###### Limitations

(2) A director of a corporation is not liable unless

  * (_a_) a certificate for the amount of the corporation’s liability has been registered in the Federal Court under section 74 and execution for that amount has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part;

  * (_b_) the corporation has commenced liquidation or dissolution proceedings or has been dissolved, and a claim for the amount of the corporation’s liability has been proved within six months after the earlier of the date of commencement of the proceedings and the date of dissolution; or

  * (_c_) the corporation has made an assignment or a bankruptcy order has been made against it under the [Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act](/canada/eng/acts/B/B-3.md), and a claim for the amount of the corporation’s liability has been proved within six months after the date of the assignment or bankruptcy order.

###### Diligence

(3) A director of a corporation is not liable for a failure under subsection (1) if the director exercised the degree of care, diligence and skill to prevent the failure that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised in comparable circumstances.

###### Assessment

(4) The Minister may assess any person for any amount payable by the person under this section and, if the Minister sends a notice of assessment, sections 39 to 52 apply with any modifications that the circumstances require.

###### Time limit

(5) An assessment of any amount payable by a person who is a director of a corporation shall not be made more than two years after the person ceased to be a director of the corporation.

###### Amount recoverable

(6) If execution referred to in paragraph (2)(_a_) has issued, the amount recoverable from a director is the amount remaining unsatisfied after execution.

###### Preference

(7) If a director of a corporation pays an amount in respect of the corporation’s liability that is proved in liquidation, dissolution or bankruptcy proceedings, the director is entitled to any preference to which Her Majesty would have been entitled had the amount not been so paid, and if a certificate that relates to the amount has been registered, the director is entitled to an assignment of the certificate to the extent of the director’s payment, which assignment the Minister is empowered to make.

###### Contribution

(8) A director who satisfies a claim under this section is entitled to contribution from the other directors who were liable for the claim.
