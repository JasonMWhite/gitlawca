## PURPOSE OF ACT

###### Purpose of Act

**3.** The purpose of this Act is to establish, as an alternative to the existing penal system and as a supplement to existing enforcement measures, a fair and efficient administrative monetary penalty system for the enforcement of the agri-food Acts.

## POWERS OF MINISTER

###### Regulations

**4.** (1) The Minister may make regulations

  * (_a_) designating as a violation that may be proceeded with in accordance with this Act

    * (i) the contravention of any specified provision of an agri-food Act or of a regulation made under an agri-food Act,

    * (ii) the contravention of any specified order, or class of orders, made by the Minister under the [Plant Protection Act](/canada/eng/acts/P/P-14.8.md), or

    * (iii) the refusal or neglect to perform any specified duty, or class of duties, imposed by or under the [Plant Protection Act](/canada/eng/acts/P/P-14.8.md) or the [Health of Animals Act](/canada/eng/acts/H/H-3.3.md),

if the contravention, or the failure or neglect to perform the duty, as the case may be, is an offence under an agri-food Act;

  * (_b_) classifying each violation as a minor violation, a serious violation or a very serious violation;

  * (_c_) fixing a penalty, or a range of penalties, in respect of each violation;

  * (_d_) respecting the circumstances under which, the criteria by which and the manner in which a penalty may be increased or reduced, including the reduction of a penalty pursuant to a compliance agreement under subsection 10(1);

  * (_e_) respecting the determination of a lesser amount that may be paid in complete satisfaction of a penalty if paid within the prescribed time and manner;

  * (_f_) respecting the circumstances under which reviews under this Act by the Tribunal shall be oral or in writing;

  * (_g_) respecting the service of documents required or authorized to be served under this Act including, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, the manner of serving such documents, the proof of their service and the circumstances under which such documents shall be deemed to have been served;

  * (_h_) prescribing anything that by this Act is to be prescribed; and

  * (_i_) generally, for carrying out the purposes and provisions of this Act.

###### Maximum penalties

(2) The maximum penalty for a violation is

  * (_a_) in the case of a violation that is committed by an individual otherwise than in the course of a business and that is not committed to obtain a financial benefit, $2,000; and

  * (_b_) in any other case, $2,000 for a minor violation, $10,000 for a serious violation and $15,000 for a very serious violation.

###### Criteria

(3) Without restricting the generality of paragraph (1)(_d_), in making regulations respecting the criteria for increasing or reducing the amount of the penalty for a violation, the Minister shall include the following in any such criteria:

  * (_a_) the degree of intention or negligence on the part of the person who committed the violation;

  * (_b_) the harm done by the violation; and

  * (_c_) the history of the person who committed the violation of prior violations or convictions under agri-food Acts within the five year period immediately before the violation.

###### How act or omission may be proceeded with

**5.** Where any act or omission can be proceeded with as a violation or as an offence, the Minister may commence proceedings in respect of that act or omission as a violation or recommend that it be proceeded with as an offence, but proceeding with it as a violation precludes proceeding with it as an offence, and proceeding with it as an offence precludes proceeding with it as a violation.

###### Duties of Minister re notices of violation

**6.** The Minister may

  * (_a_) designate persons, or classes of persons, who are authorized to issue notices of violation; and

  * (_b_) establish, in respect of each violation, a short-form description to be used in notices of violation.

## PROCEEDINGS

###### Commission of violation

**7.** (1) Every person who

  * (_a_) contravenes any provision of an agri-food Act or of a regulation made under an agri-food Act,

  * (_b_) contravenes any order made by the Minister under the [Plant Protection Act](/canada/eng/acts/P/P-14.8.md), or

  * (_c_) refuses or neglects to perform any duty imposed by or under the [Plant Protection Act](/canada/eng/acts/P/P-14.8.md) or the [Health of Animals Act](/canada/eng/acts/H/H-3.3.md)

the contravention of which, or the refusal or neglect of which, is designated to be a violation by a regulation made under paragraph 4(1)(_a_) commits a violation and is liable to a warning or to a penalty in accordance with this Act.

###### Issuance of notice of violation

(2) Where a person designated under paragraph 6(_a_) has reasonable grounds to believe that a person has committed a violation, the designated person may issue, and shall cause to be served on the person, a notice of violation that names the person, identifies the violation and

  * (_a_) contains a warning that the person has committed a violation; or

  * (_b_) sets out

    * (i) the penalty, established in accordance with the regulations, for the violation that the person is liable to pay,

    * (ii) particulars concerning the time for paying and the manner of paying the penalty, and

    * (iii) subject to the regulations, a lesser amount that may be paid in complete satisfaction of the penalty if paid within the time and manner specified in the notice.

###### Summary of rights

(3) A notice of violation must clearly summarize, in plain language, the rights and obligations under this Act of the person on whom it is served, including the right to have the facts of the violation reviewed by the Minister or the Tribunal, and the procedure for requesting such a review.

  * (_c_) the proceedings commenced in respect of the violation under section 7 are ended.

###### Alternatives to payment

## RULES OF LAW ABOUT VIOLATIONS

###### Violations not offences

###### Certain defences not available

**18.** (1) A person named in a notice of violation does not have a defence by reason that the person

###### Common law principles

(2) Every rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse in relation to a charge for an offence under an agri-food Act applies in respect of a violation to the extent that it is not inconsistent with this Act.

###### Burden of proof

**19.** In every case where the facts of a violation are reviewed by the Minister or by the Tribunal, the Minister must establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the person named in the notice of violation committed the violation identified in the notice.

###### Vicarious liability — licence holders, etc.

**20.** (1) The holder of a licence, certificate, letter of accreditation, permit, notice or other document issued under an agri-food Act is liable for a violation that is committed in respect of any matter relating to any activity or requirement under that document, whether or not the person who actually committed the violation is identified or proceeded against in accordance with this Act.

###### Vicarious liability — acts of employees and agents

(2) A person is liable for a violation that is committed by any employee or agent of the person acting in the course of the employee’s employment or the scope of the agent’s authority, whether or not the employee or agent who actually committed the violation is identified or proceeded against in accordance with this Act.

###### Continuing violation

**21.** A violation that is continued on more than one day constitutes a separate violation in respect of each day during which it is continued.

###### Forfeiture

**22.** Where

  * (_a_) a person is deemed by this Act to have committed a violation, or

  * (_b_) the Minister, pursuant to a review under this Act, has decided that a person has committed a violation and no request to review the Minister’s decision has been made to the Tribunal in the prescribed time and manner,

anything seized and detained under an agri-food Act in relation to the violation is, at the election of Her Majesty in right of Canada, immediately forfeited to Her Majesty in right of Canada and may be disposed of, at the expense of the person from whom it was seized, in accordance with the regulations made under the applicable agri-food Act unless the Minister directs otherwise.

## GENERAL PROVISIONS

###### Notations removed

**23.** (1) Any notation of a violation shall, on application by the person who committed the violation, be removed from any records that may be kept by the Minister respecting that person after the expiration of five years from

  * (_a_) where the notice of violation contained a warning, the date the notice was served, or

  * (_b_) in any other case, the payment of any debt referred to in subsection 15(1),
