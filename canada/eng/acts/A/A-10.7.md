An Act to accelerate the use of alternative fuels for motor vehicles

###### Preamble

WHEREAS Canada has a commitment to environmental reform and thus to better control over the emission of greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide, and of other air pollutants;

WHEREAS damage to the environment is caused by the emission of air pollutants by internal combustion engines using conventional fuels;
