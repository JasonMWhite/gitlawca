# Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act

R.S.C., 1985, c. A-12

An Act to prevent pollution of areas of the arctic waters adjacent to the mainland and islands of the Canadian arctic

###### Preamble

WHEREAS Parliament recognizes that recent developments in relation to the exploitation of the natural resources of arctic areas, including the natural resources of the Canadian arctic, and the transportation of those resources to the markets of the world are of potentially great significance to international trade and commerce and to the economy of Canada in particular;
