  * (_b_) the pension, if any, to which he is entitled under subsection (2);

###### Seconded officers

(9) Any officer who is or has been seconded shall, during the time that he is seconded, continue to contribute, from time to time, to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, sums equal to the deductions that would have been made from his pay if he had not been seconded, and he is in such case, upon his retirement from the force, entitled, subject to this Act, to the pension that he would have received if he had continued to serve in the force until the time of his retirement.

###### Service in public service, C.E.F., etc.

(10) In the case of an officer who has been seconded or given leave of absence for service in a position in the public service of Canada or in the Canadian Expeditionary Force or in any other military force raised in Canada for service outside Canada and paid and maintained by the Government of Canada, or who has been permitted to serve in any such force, deductions at the rate of five per cent per annum shall be made from the salary or pay, as the case may be, which such officer is receiving in the public service or as an officer in any such force, and those deductions shall form part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund and shall be treated in all respects as deductions under this Act; and, notwithstanding anything in this Act, the pension granted an officer thus seconded, or thus serving in any such force shall be based on the average annual salary and allowances or pay and allowances, as the case may be, that, during the three years immediately preceding his retirement, the said officer received from the said Government in the public service, or in such force in whichever he may have been serving during the said three years.

###### Computation of pension of officers subject to Civil Service Superannuation Act

(12) The pension to which any such officer may become entitled shall be computed in respect of the average annual pay and allowances or salary and allowances of which he was in receipt while serving in the force, or, if seconded, in the public service of Canada, as the case may be, during the three years immediately preceding his retirement from the force.
