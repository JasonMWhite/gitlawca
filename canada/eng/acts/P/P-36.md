  * R.S., 1985, c. P-36, s. 68;
  * 1992, c. 46, s. 30.

###### Calculation of benefit

**69.** (1) The supplementary benefit payable to a recipient for a month in any year shall be calculated with reference to the retirement year of the recipient and shall be equal to the amount of the supplementary retirement benefit that would be payable with respect to the recipient’s pension under section 4 of the [Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act](/canada/eng/acts/S/S-24.md) if that Act applied to the recipient.

###### Exception for first year benefits received

(2) The supplementary benefit payable to a recipient for a month in the year immediately following the recipient’s retirement year is equal to the product obtained by multiplying

  * (_a_) the amount of the supplementary benefit that would, but for this section, be payable to the recipient for that month

by

  * (_b_) the ratio that the number of complete months that remained in the retirement year after the retirement month bears to twelve.

###### Determination of retirement year or month

(3) For the purposes of this section,

  * (_a_) the retirement year or retirement month of a person to or in respect of whom or in respect of whose service a pension is payable, other than a person referred to in paragraph (_b_), is the year or month, as the case may be, in which, for the purposes of this Act, that person most recently ceased to be employed in the public service; and

  * (_b_) the retirement year or retirement month of a person who is in receipt of a pension by virtue of being a survivor or a child, is the retirement year or retirement month, as the case may be, of the person in respect of whom or in respect of whose service the pension is payable.

###### Deemed retirement year

(4) For the purpose of subsection (3), when that subsection is applied in determining under subsection (2) the supplementary benefit payable to a person in respect of a pension payable pursuant to subsection 17(2) or section 24.2, that person is deemed to have ceased to be employed at the time the person ceased to be employed in operational service as defined in section 15 or 24.1, as the case may be.

###### No decrease in amount of supplementary benefit

(5) Notwithstanding subsection (1) but subject to section 70, the aggregate of the amount of the supplementary benefit and the amount of the pension that may be paid to a recipient for a month in any year shall not be less than the aggregate of the amount of the supplementary benefit and the amount of the pension that was or may be paid to that recipient for any month in the year next before that year.

###### Recipients for whom retirement year is after 1975

(6) Notwithstanding subsections (1), (2) and (5) but subject to section 70, the amount of the supplementary benefit that may be paid for a month in any year to a recipient in respect of whom the retirement year determined pursuant to subsection (3) is 1976 or a later year shall not be less than an amount equal to the difference obtained by subtracting the amount of the pension that may be paid to the recipient for that month in that year from the aggregate of the supplementary benefit and the maximum pension that would have been payable to that recipient for that month in that year, otherwise than pursuant to this section, if the retirement month of the retirement year of the recipient had been that month in such year, being a year after 1974, as is determined by

  * (_a_) the Governor in Council, in the case of a person to or in respect of whom the pension is payable on ceasing to hold an office to which the person was appointed by the Governor in Council; or

  * (_b_) the Treasury Board, in the case of a person other than a person described in paragraph (_a_).

  * R.S., 1985, c. P-36, s. 69;

  * 2003, c. 22, s. 225(E).

###### Manner of payment of benefit

(2) [Repealed, 1999, c. 34, s. 112]

  * R.S., 1985, c. P-36, s. 70;
  * 1992, c. 46, s. 30;
