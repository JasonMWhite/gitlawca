## HER MAJESTY

###### Act binds Crown

**3.** This Act is binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province.

## APPLICATION

###### Varieties to which Act applies

**4.** (1) The varieties of plants in respect of which this Act provides for the granting of plant breeders’ rights are restricted to varieties belonging to prescribed categories and found, pursuant to subsection 27(1), to be new varieties.

###### New varieties

(2) A plant variety is a new variety if it

  * (_a_) is, by reason of one or more identifiable characteristics, clearly distinguishable from all varieties the existence of which is a matter of common knowledge at the effective date of application for the grant of the plant breeder’s rights respecting that plant variety;

  * (_b_) is stable in its essential characteristics in that after repeated reproduction or propagation or, where the applicant has defined a particular cycle of reproduction or multiplication, at the end of each cycle, remains true to its description; and

  * (_c_) is, having regard to the particular features of its sexual reproduction or vegetative propagation, a sufficiently homogeneous variety.

###### Definition of “sufficiently homogeneous variety”

(3) In paragraph (2)(_c_), “sufficiently homogeneous variety” means such a variety that, in the event of its sexual reproduction or vegetative propagation in substantial quantity, any variations in characteristics of plants so reproduced or propagated are predictable, capable of being described and commercially acceptable.

## PLANT BREEDER’S RIGHTS

###### Nature of plant breeder’s rights

**5.** (1) Subject to this Act, the holder of the plant breeder’s rights respecting a plant variety has the exclusive right

  * (_a_) to sell, and produce in Canada for the purpose of selling, propagating material, as such, of the plant variety;

  * (_b_) to make repeated use of propagating material of the plant variety in order to produce commercially another plant variety if the repetition is necessary for that purpose;

  * (_c_) where it is a plant variety to which ornamental plants or parts thereof normally marketed for purposes other than propagation belong, to use any such plants or parts commercially as propagating material in the production of ornamental plants or cut flowers; and

  * (_d_) to authorize, conditionally or unconditionally, the doing of an act described in paragraphs (_a_) to (_c_).

###### Exemption

(2) Paragraph (1)(_a_) does not apply in respect of the sale of propagating material that is not in Canada when it is sold but, if any such propagating material the sale of which to any person is exempted from that paragraph by this subsection is used as propagating material in Canada by that person, an infringement of the exclusive right conferred by virtue of that paragraph is constituted by the purchase and subsequent use of the propagating material by that person, who shall be liable to be proceeded against in respect of that infringement.

###### Implications

(3) A sale of propagating material in the exercise of any exclusive right conferred by subsection (1) does not imply that the seller authorizes the purchaser to produce, for the purpose of selling, propagating material as such but, subject to any terms or conditions imposed by the seller, the sale implies that the seller authorizes the purchaser to sell anything sold, in that exercise of the exclusive right, to the purchaser.

###### Royalty

(4) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (1)(_d_) and without prejudice to any rights or privileges of the Crown, where authority is conferred subject to conditions pursuant to that paragraph, whether or not the holder of the plant breeder’s rights is Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province, the conditions may include a requirement to pay royalty to the holder.

###### Term of plant breeder’s rights

**6.** (1) The term of the grant of plant breeder’s rights shall, subject to earlier termination pursuant to this Act, be a period of eighteen years, commencing on the day the certificate of registration is issued under paragraph 27(3)(_b_).

###### Payment of annual fee

(2) A holder of plant breeder’s rights shall, during the term of the grant of those rights, pay to the Commissioner the prescribed annual fee in respect of those rights.

## APPLICATIONS FOR PLANT BREEDER’S RIGHTS

###### Entitlement to apply for plant breeder’s rights

**7.** (1) Subject to section 8, a breeder of a new variety or a legal representative of the breeder may make an application to the Commissioner for the grant of plant breeder’s rights respecting that variety if

  * (_a_) in the case of a new variety of a recently prescribed category, neither the breeder nor a legal representative of the breeder sold or concurred in the sale of that variety in Canada before the commencement of such period prior to the date of receipt, by the Commissioner, of the application as is prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph;

  * (_b_) in any other case, neither the breeder nor a legal representative of the breeder sold or concurred in the sale of that variety in Canada before the effective date of the application; and

###### Priority and dating of application

**10.** (1) Subject to subsections (2) and 11(1), the effective date of an application is the date on which the application is received by the Commissioner and, in the case of receipt by the Commissioner of two or more applications respecting a new variety the breeders of which bred it independently of each other, priority shall be given to the application first received by the Commissioner.

###### Applications of same date

(2) Where the effective dates of applications described in subsection (1) are the same, priority shall be given to the application pertaining to the breeder who was first in a position to apply for the plant breeder’s rights respecting the new variety or who would have been first in the position to do so if the provision made by or under this Act for so doing had always been in force.

###### Priority based on preceding application in country of Union or agreement country

**11.** (1) Where an application made under section 7 is preceded by an application made, in the appropriate manner, in a country of the Union or an agreement country, for protection pursuant to the breeding of the same new variety by the same breeder as in the case of the application made under section 7, the date that is the effective date of the application made in that country shall be deemed to be the effective date of the application made under section 7 and the applicant is entitled to priority in Canada accordingly, notwithstanding any intervening use, publication or application respecting the new variety, if

  * (_a_) the application is made under section 7 in the prescribed form within twelve months after the date on which the application was made in that country; and

(3) An application given priority under subsection (1) shall be supported by the required material furnished pursuant to this Act and the regulations before the expiration of the prescribed period, not exceeding four years, after the last day of the twelve months within which the application is submitted in accordance with paragraph (1)(_a_).

###### Cases of two or more preceding applications

(4) Where an application made under section 7 is preceded by two or more applications made, in the appropriate manner, in different countries of the Union or agreement countries, for protection pursuant to the breeding of the same new variety by the same breeder as in the case of the application made under section 7, reference in subsection (1) to an application made in any such country shall be construed as reference to whichever of those applications was first made.

###### Priority conditional on residence, etc.

**12.** (1) No claim referred to in paragraph 11(1)(_b_) shall be based on any preceding application unless it was made by a person who, at the time of the application, was a citizen of, or a person resident or having a registered office in, Canada or a country of the Union or an agreement country.

## DENOMINATIONS OF NEW VARIETIES

###### Denomination of new varieties

**14.** (1) A new variety in respect of which an application for the grant of plant breeder’s rights is made shall be designated by means of a denomination proposed by the applicant and approved by the Commissioner.

###### Rejection of proposed denomination

(2) Where a denomination is proposed pursuant to subsection (1), the Commissioner may, during the pendency of the application referred to in that subsection, reject the proposed denomination, if considered unsuitable for any reasonable cause by the Commissioner, and direct the applicant to submit a suitable denomination instead.

###### Suitable denomination

(3) A denomination, in order to be suitable pursuant to this section, must conform to the prescribed requirements and must not be such as to be likely to mislead or to cause confusion concerning the characteristics, value or identity of the variety in question or the identity of its breeder.

###### International uniformity of denomination

(4) A denomination that the Commissioner approves for any new variety in respect of which protection has been granted by, or an application for protection has been submitted to, the appropriate authority in a country of the Union or an agreement country must, subject to subsections (2), (3) and (5), be the same as any denomination with reference to which that protection has been granted or that application submitted.

  * (_b_) that the person making the application is not entitled in accordance with section 7 or 8 to do so.

###### Opportunity for representations before application rejected

(2) The Commissioner shall not reject the application of a person for the grant of plant breeder’s rights without first giving the person notice of the objections to it and of the grounds for those objections as well as a reasonable opportunity to make representations with respect thereto.

## PROTECTIVE DIRECTIONS

###### Protective directions

**19.** (1) An application for the grant of plant breeder’s rights may include an application, accompanied by the fee prescribed in respect thereof, to the Commissioner for a protective direction respecting the plant variety in relation to which the application is made.

###### Undertaking

(2) Every person applying for a protective direction in accordance with subsection (1) shall undertake not to sell during the subsistence thereof propagating material of the plant variety unless the sale is made in good faith for purposes of scientific research, is part of a transaction involving the sale of the plant breeder’s rights or consists of the sale of propagating material for the purpose of accumulating stock for subsequent resale to that person.

###### Grant of protective direction

(3) Subject to subsection (4), where the undertaking required by subsection (2) is given, the Commissioner shall grant a protective direction to the person giving the undertaking and anything done while the protective direction is in force that, if the plant breeder’s rights respecting the plant variety were granted, would constitute an infringement of those rights is actionable pursuant to this section as if it were such an infringement.

###### Refusal of grant
