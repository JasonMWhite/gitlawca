###### Witness post to be marked “W.P.”

**27.** Where it is impossible, owing to the presence of water or other insurmountable obstacle, to set post No. 2 in its proper position at one end of the location line, the locator of a mineral claim may set up a witness post on the location line as near as possible to where post No. 2 should have been placed, and on that witness post he shall place, in addition to that already prescribed in this Part to be placed on post No. 2, the letters “W.P.” and the distance in feet and the direction of the point at which post No. 2 would have been placed had it been possible to do so.

###### Particulars of inscriptions

**32.** (1) Particulars of all inscriptions put on post No. 1 and post No. 2 shall be furnished by the locator of a mineral claim to a mining recorder in writing at the time the claim is recorded and shall form a part of the record of the claim.

###### Plan to be submitted

(2) The locator of a mineral claim shall submit with his application for recording the claim a plan in duplicate showing as clearly as possible the position of the location applied for in its relation to the prominent topographical features of the district and to the adjoining claims or any other known point and the position of the stakes by which the location is marked on the ground.

###### Validity of location

**33.** Failure on the part of any locator of any mineral claim located in the Territory prior to July 19, 1924 to have complied in every respect with the provisions of the mining regulations or of this Part governing the location of that mineral claim, with respect to exact size of location posts and discovery posts, the erection of a mound of stones or earth around the base of the posts and failure to have discovered mineral or minerals in place within the area of that claim or on the location, shall be deemed not to invalidate the location or the record and title of that claim, if there has been an approximate and substantial compliance with the mining regulations or law in force and regulating and governing the location and recording of mineral claims at the time of the location of that claim, and if the non-observance of any of the requirements with respect to location, application and recording is not of a character calculated to mislead other persons desiring to locate claims in the vicinity.

  * R.S., 1985, c. Y-4, s. 33;
  * 1996, c. 27, s. 10.

## REMOVING OR DEFACING POSTS

###### Removing or defacing posts

**34.** (1) It shall not be lawful to move post No. 1, and post No. 2 may be moved only by a Canada Lands Surveyor, when it is found on making a survey that the distance between post No. 1 and post No. 2 exceeds one thousand five hundred feet, in order to place post No. 2 at a distance of one thousand five hundred feet from post No. 1 on the line of location of a mineral claim.

###### Distance less than 1,500 feet

(2) When the distance between post No. 1 and post No. 2 is less than one thousand five hundred feet, the mineral claim shall not extend beyond post No. 2 as originally placed.

## WHAT ENTRY OR LEASE CONVEYS

###### To what holder of mineral claim entitled

**76.** (1) The holder of a mineral claim, by entry or by lease, located on vacant territorial lands is entitled to

  * (_a_) all minerals found in veins or lodes, whether the minerals are found separate or in combination with each other in, on or under the lands included in the entry or lease, together with the right to enter on and use and occupy the surface of the claim, or such portion thereof and to such extent as the Minister may consider necessary, for the efficient and miner-like operation of the mines and minerals contained in the claim, but for no other purpose; and

  * (_b_) the right to cut free of dues such of the timber on the claim or such portion thereof as may be necessary for the working of the claim, but not for sale or traffic, except where the timber has been granted or disposed of prior to the date of entry.

###### Timber for owner’s use

(2) A timber agent may permit any person to cut and remove from a mineral claim timber for his own use for mining purposes when the timber cannot otherwise be had within a reasonable distance, but no such permit conveys the right to cut or remove timber required by the holder of the claim for his mining operations actually in progress.

  * R.S., c. Y-4, s. 72.

###### Lease of surface rights

**77.** (1) The Minister may, on application, grant to the holder of a mineral claim, in good standing, located on vacant territorial lands, and acquired by entry or by lease, a lease of the whole or any portion of the available surface rights of the mineral claim at a rental of one dollar an acre per annum, payable yearly in advance.

###### Term of lease

(2) The term of a lease of the surface rights of a mineral claim shall not exceed the term of the record grant or lease issued for the minerals under this Part or former mining regulations, and shall be appurtenant to that grant.

###### Termination of lease

(3) The Minister may at any time, by giving the lessee three months notice in writing of his intention, terminate a lease of the surface rights of a mineral claim, without compensation to the lessee for the termination or for any buildings or other improvements that the lessee may have placed on the location, but the lessee may be given the privilege of removing from the location any buildings and improvements that may have been placed thereon by him.

###### Consent of Minister

(4) A lessee shall not assign, transfer or sublet the rights described in a lease of the surface rights of a mineral claim, or any portion thereof, without the consent in writing of the Minister being first obtained.

  * R.S., 1985, c. Y-4, s. 77;
  * 1996, c. 27, s. 10.

###### Timber reserved

**78.** (1) The timber on a mineral claim shall, subject to the rights existing at the time of the application therefor, be reserved until a mining recorder certifies that the timber is required for use in connection with mining operations actually in progress on the mineral claim, when the right to use the timber, or any portion thereof, free of dues, may be given the holder of the mineral claim by the Crown timber and land agent with the approval of the Commissioner.

###### Authorizing permit

(2) The Commissioner may authorize a timber agent to issue a permit to any person to cut and remove from the mineral claim timber required by the person for his own use in mining operations when the timber cannot otherwise be obtained within a reasonable distance of the place of his mining operations.

  * R.S., c. Y-4, s. 73.

###### Effect when prospecting rights reserved

**79.** A lease of a mineral claim located on lands the surface rights of which have been disposed of but the right whereon to enter, prospect and mine for minerals has been reserved to the Crown conveys to the lessee the minerals found in veins or lodes, whether the minerals are found separately or in combination with each other, that may be in, on or under the land described in the lease, but conveys no right of entry on the surface.

  * R.S., c. Y-4, s. 74.

###### Reservation of timber

**80.** Where a mineral claim is located on land lawfully occupied under a timber licence, the lease conveys the minerals found in veins or lodes, subject to section 15, but reserves the timber.

  * R.S., c. Y-4, s. 75.

###### When right to mine gold and silver reserved

**81.** A lease of a mineral claim located on lands the surface rights of which have been disposed of but the right whereon to enter and mine gold and silver has been reserved to the Crown conveys to the lessee the right to the gold and silver found in veins or lodes that may be in, on or under the land described in the lease, but conveys no right of entry on the surface.

  * R.S., c. Y-4, s. 76.

###### Water for mining purposes

**82.** A lease of a mineral claim issued under this Part reserves to the Crown such right or rights-of-way and of entry as may be required under any law or regulation in force on or after July 19, 1924 in connection with the construction, maintenance and use of works for the conveyance of water for mining operations.

  * R.S., 1985, c. Y-4, s. 82;
  * 1996, c. 27, s. 10.

###### Joint applicants for renewal

**83.** Where two or more persons have the right of renewing a lease from the Crown, each of those persons shall proportionately to his interest contribute to the payment of rental and fees for the renewal of that lease, and if it is proved to the Commissioner after a notice of hearing has been served on all parties interested, in the manner directed by the Commissioner, that one of those persons has not contributed and that the other person or persons have paid the full rental and fees for the renewal of the lease, the Minister may issue the lease to the person or persons who have paid the rental and fees.
