## DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLE

###### Policy for Canada with respect to young offenders

**3.** (1) It is hereby recognized and declared that

  * (_a_) crime prevention is essential to the long-term protection of society and requires addressing the underlying causes of crime by young persons and developing multi-disciplinary approaches to identifying and effectively responding to children and young persons at risk of committing offending behaviour in the future;

  * (_a.1_) while young persons should not in all instances be held accountable in the same manner or suffer the same consequences for their behaviour as adults, young persons who commit offences should nonetheless bear responsibility for their contraventions;

  * (_b_) society must, although it has the responsibility to take reasonable measures to prevent criminal conduct by young persons, be afforded the necessary protection from illegal behaviour;

  * (_c_) young persons who commit offences require supervision, discipline and control, but, because of their state of dependency and level of development and maturity, they also have special needs and require guidance and assistance;

  * (_c.1_) the protection of society, which is a primary objective of the criminal law applicable to youth, is best served by rehabilitation, wherever possible, of young persons who commit offences, and rehabilitation is best achieved by addressing the needs and circumstances of a young person that are relevant to the young person’s offending behaviour;

  * (_d_) where it is not inconsistent with the protection of society, taking no measures or taking measures other than judicial proceedings under this Act should be considered for dealing with young persons who have committed offences;

  * (_e_) young persons have rights and freedoms in their own right, including those stated in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or in the [Canadian Bill of Rights](/canada/eng/acts/C/C-12.3.md), and in particular a right to be heard in the course of, and to participate in, the processes that lead to decisions that affect them, and young persons should have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms;

  * (_f_) in the application of this Act, the rights and freedoms of young persons include a right to the least possible interference with freedom that is consistent with the protection of society, having regard to the needs of young persons and the interests of their families;

  * (_g_) young persons have the right, in every instance where they have rights or freedoms that may be affected by this Act, to be informed as to what those rights and freedoms are; and

  * (_h_) parents have responsibility for the care and supervision of their children, and, for that reason, young persons should be removed from parental supervision either partly or entirely only when measures that provide for continuing parental supervision are inappropriate.

###### Act to be liberally construed

(2) This Act shall be liberally construed to the end that young persons will be dealt with in accordance with the principles set out in subsection (1).

  * R.S., 1985, c. Y-1, s. 3;
  * 1995, c. 19, s. 1.

## ALTERNATIVE MEASURES

###### Alternative measures

**4.** (1) Alternative measures may be used to deal with a young person alleged to have committed an offence instead of judicial proceedings under this Act only if

  * (_a_) the measures are part of a program of alternative measures authorized by the Attorney General or his delegate or authorized by a person, or a person within a class of persons, designated by the Lieutenant Governor in Council of a province;

  * (_b_) the person who is considering whether to use such measures is satisfied that they would be appropriate, having regard to the needs of the young person and the interests of society;

  * (_c_) the young person, having been informed of the alternative measures, fully and freely consents to participate therein;

  * (_d_) the young person has, before consenting to participate in the alternative measures, been advised of his right to be represented by counsel and been given a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel;

  * (_e_) the young person accepts responsibility for the act or omission that forms the basis of the offence that he is alleged to have committed;

  * (_f_) there is, in the opinion of the Attorney General or his agent, sufficient evidence to proceed with the prosecution of the offence; and

  * (_g_) the prosecution of the offence is not in any way barred at law.

###### Restriction on use

(2) Alternative measures shall not be used to deal with a young person alleged to have committed an offence if the young person

  * (_a_) denies his participation or involvement in the commission of the offence; or

  * (_b_) expresses his wish to have any charge against him dealt with by the youth court.

###### Admissions not admissible in evidence

(3) No admission, confession or statement accepting responsibility for a given act or omission made by a young person alleged to have committed an offence as a condition of his being dealt with by alternative measures shall be admissible in evidence against him in any civil or criminal proceedings.

###### No bar to proceedings

(4) The use of alternative measures in respect of a young person alleged to have committed an offence is not a bar to proceedings against him under this Act, but

  * (_a_) where the youth court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the young person has totally complied with the terms and conditions of the alternative measures, the youth court shall dismiss any charge against him; and

  * (_b_) where the youth court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the young person has partially complied with the terms and conditions of the alternative measures, the youth court may dismiss any charge against him if, in the opinion of the court, the prosecution of the charge would, having regard to the circumstances, be unfair, and the youth court may consider the young person’s performance with respect to the alternative measures before making a disposition under this Act.

###### Laying of information, etc.

(5) Subject to subsection (4), nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any person from laying an information, obtaining the issue or confirmation of any process or proceeding with the prosecution of any offence in accordance with law.

  * 1980-81-82-83, c. 110, s. 4.
