# Youth Criminal Justice Act

S.C. 2002, c. 1

Assented to 2002-02-19

An Act in respect of criminal justice for young persons and to amend and repeal other Acts

###### Preamble

WHEREAS members of society share a responsibility to address the developmental challenges and the needs of young persons and to guide them into adulthood;

WHEREAS communities, families, parents and others concerned with the development of young persons should, through multi-disciplinary approaches, take reasonable steps to prevent youth crime by addressing its underlying causes, to respond to the needs of young persons, and to provide guidance and support to those at risk of committing crimes;

WHEREAS information about youth justice, youth crime and the effectiveness of measures taken to address youth crime should be publicly available;

WHEREAS Canada is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and recognizes that young persons have rights and freedoms, including those stated in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Bill of Rights, and have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms;

AND WHEREAS Canadian society should have a youth criminal justice system that commands respect, takes into account the interests of victims, fosters responsibility and ensures accountability through meaningful consequences and effective rehabilitation and reintegration, and that reserves its most serious intervention for the most serious crimes and reduces the over-reliance on incarceration for non-violent young persons;

NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:

## DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLE

###### Policy for Canada with respect to young persons

**3.** (1) The following principles apply in this Act:

  * (_a_) the youth criminal justice system is intended to

    * (i) prevent crime by addressing the circumstances underlying a young person’s offending behaviour,

    * (ii) rehabilitate young persons who commit offences and reintegrate them into society, and

    * (iii) ensure that a young person is subject to meaningful consequences for his or her offence

in order to promote the long-term protection of the public;

  * (_b_) the criminal justice system for young persons must be separate from that of adults and emphasize the following:

    * (i) rehabilitation and reintegration,

    * (ii) fair and proportionate accountability that is consistent with the greater dependency of young persons and their reduced level of maturity,

    * (iii) enhanced procedural protection to ensure that young persons are treated fairly and that their rights, including their right to privacy, are protected,

    * (iv) timely intervention that reinforces the link between the offending behaviour and its consequences, and

    * (v) the promptness and speed with which persons responsible for enforcing this Act must act, given young persons’ perception of time;

  * (_c_) within the limits of fair and proportionate accountability, the measures taken against young persons who commit offences should

    * (i) reinforce respect for societal values,

    * (ii) encourage the repair of harm done to victims and the community,

    * (iii) be meaningful for the individual young person given his or her needs and level of development and, where appropriate, involve the parents, the extended family, the community and social or other agencies in the young person’s rehabilitation and reintegration, and

    * (iv) respect gender, ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences and respond to the needs of aboriginal young persons and of young persons with special requirements; and

  * (_d_) special considerations apply in respect of proceedings against young persons and, in particular,

    * (i) young persons have rights and freedoms in their own right, such as a right to be heard in the course of and to participate in the processes, other than the decision to prosecute, that lead to decisions that affect them, and young persons have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms,

    * (ii) victims should be treated with courtesy, compassion and respect for their dignity and privacy and should suffer the minimum degree of inconvenience as a result of their involvement with the youth criminal justice system,

    * (iii) victims should be provided with information about the proceedings and given an opportunity to participate and be heard, and

    * (iv) parents should be informed of measures or proceedings involving their children and encouraged to support them in addressing their offending behaviour.

###### Act to be liberally construed

(2) This Act shall be liberally construed so as to ensure that young persons are dealt with in accordance with the principles set out in subsection (1).

## PART 1 - EXTRAJUDICIAL MEASURES

## Principles and Objectives

###### Declaration of principles

**4.** The following principles apply in this Part in addition to the principles set out in section 3:

  * (_a_) extrajudicial measures are often the most appropriate and effective way to address youth crime;

  * (_b_) extrajudicial measures allow for effective and timely interventions focused on correcting offending behaviour;

  * (_c_) extrajudicial measures are presumed to be adequate to hold a young person accountable for his or her offending behaviour if the young person has committed a non-violent offence and has not previously been found guilty of an offence; and

  * (_d_) extrajudicial measures should be used if they are adequate to hold a young person accountable for his or her offending behaviour and, if the use of extrajudicial measures is consistent with the principles set out in this section, nothing in this Act precludes their use in respect of a young person who

    * (i) has previously been dealt with by the use of extrajudicial measures, or

    * (ii) has previously been found guilty of an offence.

###### Objectives

**5.** Extrajudicial measures should be designed to

  * (_a_) provide an effective and timely response to offending behaviour outside the bounds of judicial measures;

  * (_b_) encourage young persons to acknowledge and repair the harm caused to the victim and the community;

  * (_c_) encourage families of young persons — including extended families where appropriate — and the community to become involved in the design and implementation of those measures;

  * (_d_) provide an opportunity for victims to participate in decisions related to the measures selected and to receive reparation; and

  * (_e_) respect the rights and freedoms of young persons and be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence.

## Warnings, Cautions and Referrals

###### Warnings, cautions and referrals

**6.** (1) A police officer shall, before starting judicial proceedings or taking any other measures under this Act against a young person alleged to have committed an offence, consider whether it would be sufficient, having regard to the principles set out in section 4, to take no further action, warn the young person, administer a caution, if a program has been established under section 7, or, with the consent of the young person, refer the young person to a program or agency in the community that may assist the young person not to commit offences.

###### Saving

(2) The failure of a police officer to consider the options set out in subsection (1) does not invalidate any subsequent charges against the young person for the offence.

###### Police cautions

**7.** The Attorney General, or any other minister designated by the lieutenant governor of a province, may establish a program authorizing the police to administer cautions to young persons instead of starting judicial proceedings under this Act.

###### Crown cautions

**8.** The Attorney General may establish a program authorizing prosecutors to administer cautions to young persons instead of starting or continuing judicial proceedings under this Act.

###### Evidence of measures is inadmissible

**9.** Evidence that a young person has received a warning, caution or referral mentioned in section 6, 7 or 8 or that a police officer has taken no further action in respect of an offence, and evidence of the offence, is inadmissible for the purpose of proving prior offending behaviour in any proceedings before a youth justice court in respect of the young person.

## Extrajudicial Sanctions

###### Extrajudicial sanctions

**10.** (1) An extrajudicial sanction may be used to deal with a young person alleged to have committed an offence only if the young person cannot be adequately dealt with by a warning, caution or referral mentioned in section 6, 7 or 8 because of the seriousness of the offence, the nature and number of previous offences committed by the young person or any other aggravating circumstances.

###### Conditions

(2) An extrajudicial sanction may be used only if

  * (_a_) it is part of a program of sanctions that may be authorized by the Attorney General or authorized by a person, or a member of a class of persons, designated by the lieutenant governor in council of the province;

  * (_b_) the person who is considering whether to use the extrajudicial sanction is satisfied that it would be appropriate, having regard to the needs of the young person and the interests of society;

  * (_c_) the young person, having been informed of the extrajudicial sanction, fully and freely consents to be subject to it;

  * (_d_) the young person has, before consenting to be subject to the extrajudicial sanction, been advised of his or her right to be represented by counsel and been given a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel;

  * (_e_) the young person accepts responsibility for the act or omission that forms the basis of the offence that he or she is alleged to have committed;

  * (_f_) there is, in the opinion of the Attorney General, sufficient evidence to proceed with the prosecution of the offence; and

  * (_g_) the prosecution of the offence is not in any way barred at law.

###### Restriction on use

(3) An extrajudicial sanction may not be used in respect of a young person who

  * (_a_) denies participation or involvement in the commission of the offence; or

  * (_b_) expresses the wish to have the charge dealt with by a youth justice court.

###### Admissions not admissible in evidence

(4) Any admission, confession or statement accepting responsibility for a given act or omission that is made by a young person as a condition of being dealt with by extrajudicial measures is inadmissible in evidence against any young person in civil or criminal proceedings.

###### No bar to judicial proceedings

(5) The use of an extrajudicial sanction in respect of a young person alleged to have committed an offence is not a bar to judicial proceedings under this Act, but if a charge is laid against the young person in respect of the offence,

  * (_a_) the youth justice court shall dismiss the charge if it is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the young person has totally complied with the terms and conditions of the extrajudicial sanction; and

  * (_b_) the youth justice court may dismiss the charge if it is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the young person has partially complied with the terms and conditions of the extrajudicial sanction and if, in the opinion of the court, prosecution of the charge would be unfair having regard to the circumstances and the young person’s performance with respect to the extrajudicial sanction.

###### Laying of information, etc.

(6) Subject to subsection (5) and section 24 (private prosecutions only with consent of Attorney General), nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing any person from laying an information or indictment, obtaining the issue or confirmation of any process or proceeding with the prosecution of any offence in accordance with law.

###### Notice to parent

**11.** If a young person is dealt with by an extrajudicial sanction, the person who administers the program under which the sanction is used shall inform a parent of the young person of the sanction.

###### Victim’s right to information

**12.** If a young person is dealt with by an extrajudicial sanction, a police officer, the Attorney General, the provincial director or any organization established by a province to provide assistance to victims shall, on request, inform the victim of the identity of the young person and how the offence has been dealt with.

(3) A youth justice court has jurisdiction in respect of every contempt of court committed by a young person against any other court in the face of that court and every contempt of court committed by an adult against the youth justice court in the face of the youth justice court, but nothing in this subsection affects the power, jurisdiction or authority of any other court to deal with or impose punishment for contempt of court.

## PART 4 - SENTENCING

## Purpose and Principles

###### Purpose

**38.** (1) The purpose of sentencing under section 42 (youth sentences) is to hold a young person accountable for an offence through the imposition of just sanctions that have meaningful consequences for the young person and that promote his or her rehabilitation and reintegration into society, thereby contributing to the long-term protection of the public.

###### Sentencing principles

(2) A youth justice court that imposes a youth sentence on a young person shall determine the sentence in accordance with the principles set out in section 3 and the following principles:

  * (_a_) the sentence must not result in a punishment that is greater than the punishment that would be appropriate for an adult who has been convicted of the same offence committed in similar circumstances;

  * (_b_) the sentence must be similar to the sentences imposed in the region on similar young persons found guilty of the same offence committed in similar circumstances;

  * (_c_) the sentence must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the young person for that offence;

  * (_d_) all available sanctions other than custody that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all young persons, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal young persons; and

  * (_e_) subject to paragraph (_c_), the sentence must

    * (i) be the least restrictive sentence that is capable of achieving the purpose set out in subsection (1),

    * (ii) be the one that is most likely to rehabilitate the young person and reintegrate him or her into society, and

    * (iii) promote a sense of responsibility in the young person, and an acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and the community.

###### Factors to be considered

(3) In determining a youth sentence, the youth justice court shall take into account

  * (_a_) the degree of participation by the young person in the commission of the offence;

  * (_b_) the harm done to victims and whether it was intentional or reasonably foreseeable;

  * (_c_) any reparation made by the young person to the victim or the community;

  * (_d_) the time spent in detention by the young person as a result of the offence;

  * (_e_) the previous findings of guilt of the young person; and

  * (_f_) any other aggravating and mitigating circumstances related to the young person or the offence that are relevant to the purpose and principles set out in this section.

###### Committal to custody

**39.** (1) A youth justice court shall not commit a young person to custody under section 42 (youth sentences) unless

  * (_a_) the young person has committed a violent offence;

  * (_b_) the young person has failed to comply with non-custodial sentences;

  * (_c_) the young person has committed an indictable offence for which an adult would be liable to imprisonment for a term of more than two years and has a history that indicates a pattern of findings of guilt under this Act or the [Young Offenders Act](/canada/eng/acts/Y/Y-1.md), chapter Y-1 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985; or

  * (_d_) in exceptional cases where the young person has committed an indictable offence, the aggravating circumstances of the offence are such that the imposition of a non-custodial sentence would be inconsistent with the purpose and principles set out in section 38.

###### Alternatives to custody

(2) If any of paragraphs (1)(_a_) to (_c_) apply, a youth justice court shall not impose a custodial sentence under section 42 (youth sentences) unless the court has considered all alternatives to custody raised at the sentencing hearing that are reasonable in the circumstances, and determined that there is not a reasonable alternative, or combination of alternatives, that is in accordance with the purpose and principles set out in section 38.

###### Factors to be considered

(3) In determining whether there is a reasonable alternative to custody, a youth justice court shall consider submissions relating to

  * (_a_) the alternatives to custody that are available;

  * (_b_) the likelihood that the young person will comply with a non-custodial sentence, taking into account his or her compliance with previous non-custodial sentences; and

  * (_c_) the alternatives to custody that have been used in respect of young persons for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.

###### Imposition of same sentence

(4) The previous imposition of a particular non-custodial sentence on a young person does not preclude a youth justice court from imposing the same or any other non-custodial sentence for another offence.

###### Custody as social measure prohibited

(5) A youth justice court shall not use custody as a substitute for appropriate child protection, mental health or other social measures.

###### Pre-sentence report

(6) Before imposing a custodial sentence under section 42 (youth sentences), a youth justice court shall consider a pre-sentence report and any sentencing proposal made by the young person or his or her counsel.

###### Report dispensed with

(7) A youth justice court may, with the consent of the prosecutor and the young person or his or her counsel, dispense with a pre-sentence report if the court is satisfied that the report is not necessary.

###### Length of custody

(8) In determining the length of a youth sentence that includes a custodial portion, a youth justice court shall be guided by the purpose and principles set out in section 38, and shall not take into consideration the fact that the supervision portion of the sentence may not be served in custody and that the sentence may be reviewed by the court under section 94.

###### Reasons

(9) If a youth justice court imposes a youth sentence that includes a custodial portion, the court shall state the reasons why it has determined that a non-custodial sentence is not adequate to achieve the purpose set out in subsection 38(1), including, if applicable, the reasons why the case is an exceptional case under paragraph (1)(_d_).

## Pre-sentence Report

###### Pre-sentence report

**40.** (1) Before imposing sentence on a young person found guilty of an offence, a youth justice court

  * (_a_) shall, if it is required under this Act to consider a pre-sentence report before making an order or a sentence in respect of a young person, and

###### Report may be withheld from private prosecutor

(7) If a pre-sentence report made in respect of a young person is submitted to a youth justice court, the court may, when the prosecutor is a private prosecutor and disclosure of all or part of the report to the prosecutor might, in the opinion of the court, be prejudicial to the young person and is not, in the opinion of the court, necessary for the prosecution of the case against the young person,

  * (_a_) withhold the report or part from the prosecutor, if the report is submitted in writing; or

  * (_b_) exclude the prosecutor from the court during the submission of the report or part, if the report is submitted orally in court.
