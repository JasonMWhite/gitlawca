## Charging Principles

###### Charging principles

**35.** (1) The Corporation shall observe the following principles when establishing a new charge for air navigation services or revising an existing charge:

  * (_a_) charges must be in accordance with a methodology established and published by the Corporation that is explicit and that also includes the terms and conditions affecting charges;

  * (_b_) charges must not be structured in such a way that a user would be encouraged to engage in practices that diminish safety for the purpose of avoiding a charge;

  * (_c_) charges for the same services must not differentiate between domestic and international flights of air carriers;

  * (_d_) charges for the same services must not differentiate among Canadian air carriers or among foreign air carriers;

  * (_e_) charges must differentiate between the provision of services in relation to the landing and take-off of aircraft and the provision of services in relation to aircraft in flight, and must reflect a reasonable allocation of the costs of providing the services in those circumstances;

  * (_f_) charges in respect of recreational and private aircraft must not be unreasonable or undue;

  * (_g_) charges for designated northern or remote services and for services directed to be provided under subsection 24(1) must not be higher than charges for similar services utilized to a similar extent elsewhere in Canada;

  * (_h_) charges must be consistent with the international obligations of the Government of Canada; and

###### Value of the services

(2) The charging methodology may recognize that the value of the services differs among users.

###### Application of principle

(3) Where the Corporation’s charging methodology recognizes the value of the services and aircraft weight is used as a measure of the value of the services, the principle referred to in paragraph (1)(_a_) is deemed not to have been observed if aircraft weight is taken into account either directly proportionally or greater than directly proportionally.
