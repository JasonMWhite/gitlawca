###### Declaration

**5.** It is hereby declared that a safe, economic, efficient and adequate network of viable and effective transportation services accessible to persons with disabilities and that makes the best use of all available modes of transportation at the lowest total cost is essential to serve the transportation needs of shippers and travellers, including persons with disabilities, and to maintain the economic well-being and growth of Canada and its regions and that those objectives are most likely to be achieved when all carriers are able to compete, both within and among the various modes of transportation, under conditions ensuring that, having due regard to national policy, to the advantages of harmonized federal and provincial regulatory approaches and to legal and constitutional requirements,

  * (_a_) the national transportation system meets the highest practicable safety standards,

  * (_b_) competition and market forces are, whenever possible, the prime agents in providing viable and effective transportation services,

  * (_c_) economic regulation of carriers and modes of transportation occurs only in respect of those services and regions where regulation is necessary to serve the transportation needs of shippers and travellers and that such regulation will not unfairly limit the ability of any carrier or mode of transportation to compete freely with any other carrier or mode of transportation,

  * (_d_) transportation is recognized as a key to regional economic development and that commercial viability of transportation links is balanced with regional economic development objectives so that the potential economic strengths of each region may be realized,

  * (_e_) each carrier or mode of transportation, as far as is practicable, bears a fair proportion of the real costs of the resources, facilities and services provided to that carrier or mode of transportation at public expense,

  * (_f_) each carrier or mode of transportation, as far as is practicable, receives fair and reasonable compensation for the resources, facilities and services that it is required to provide as an imposed public duty,

  * (_g_) each carrier or mode of transportation, as far as is practicable, carries traffic to or from any point in Canada under fares, rates and conditions that do not constitute

    * (i) an unfair disadvantage in respect of any such traffic beyond the disadvantage inherent in the location or volume of the traffic, the scale of operation connected with the traffic or the type of traffic or service involved,

    * (ii) an undue obstacle to the mobility of persons, including persons with disabilities,

    * (iii) an undue obstacle to the interchange of commodities between points in Canada, or

    * (iv) an unreasonable discouragement to the development of primary or secondary industries, to export trade in or from any region of Canada or to the movement of commodities through Canadian ports, and

  * (_h_) each mode of transportation is economically viable,

and this Act is enacted in accordance with and for the attainment of those objectives to the extent that they fall within the purview of subject-matters under the legislative authority of Parliament relating to transportation.

  * (_a_) a shipper has access to the lines of only one railway company at the point of origin or destination of the movement of the shipper’s traffic; and

  * (_b_) a continuous route between those points is operated by two or more companies.

###### Transferred railway lines

(2) For greater certainty, the transfer of a railway line, or an operating interest in it, under Division V or section 158 of the National Transportation Act, 1987 does not affect the right of a shipper to obtain a competitive line rate under sections 130 to 136.

###### When competitive line rate to be established on shipper’s request

**130.** (1) Subject to section 131, the local carrier serving the shipper at the point of origin or destination, as the case may be, shall, on the request of the shipper, establish a competitive line rate applicable to the movement of the traffic between the point of origin or destination, whichever is served exclusively by the local carrier, and the nearest interchange with a connecting carrier.

###### Requirement unaffected by extent of carrier’s capability

(2) The local carrier shall establish the competitive line rate even if it is able to move the traffic over the whole of the continuous route or a portion of that route that is longer than the portion in respect of which the competitive line rate is to apply.

###### Designation of route by shipper

(3) The shipper may designate the continuous route for the movement of the shipper’s traffic from the point of origin to the point of destination.

###### Route within Canada

(4) If the ultimate point of destination of a movement of the shipper’s traffic is in Canada, the shipper shall designate a route wholly within Canada, unless there is no cost-effective continuous route wholly within Canada that is available to the shipper and over which it is reasonable to move the shipper’s traffic.

###### Export and import

(5) For the purposes of this section,

  * (_a_) if the point of destination of a movement of traffic is a port in Canada for export out of Canada, that port is the ultimate point of destination in Canada; and

  * (_b_) if the point of origin of a movement of traffic is a port in Canada for import into Canada, that port is the point of origin.

###### Nearest interchange

(6) For the purposes of subsection (1), the nearest interchange is the one nearest the point of origin or destination, whichever is served exclusively by the local carrier, in the reasonable direction of the movement of the traffic from the point of origin to the point of destination on the continuous route designated by the shipper, unless the local carrier can demonstrate that the interchange cannot be used for engineering reasons.

###### Shipper and connecting carriers must agree

**131.** (1) A competitive line rate must not be established unless the shipper agrees with the connecting carrier, and with any other company, other than the local carrier, that moves traffic over a portion of the continuous route, on the terms and conditions governing their movement of the traffic, including the applicable rate.

###### No other rate applies

(2) If an interswitching rate determined under paragraph 128(1)(_b_) is available for a portion of the route operated by the local carrier, no other rate may be applied to that portion of the route.

###### Movement on flat cars or less than carload traffic

(3) A competitive line rate must not be established for the movement of trailers on flat cars, containers on flat cars or less than carload traffic, unless they arrive at a port in Canada by water for movement by rail or by rail for movement by water.

###### Maximum portion of traffic

(4) The portion of a movement of traffic in respect of which a competitive line rate may be established must not exceed 50 per cent of the total number of kilometres over which the traffic is moved by rail or 1 200 km, whichever is greater.

###### Exception

(5) On application of a shipper, the Agency may establish a competitive line rate for a greater portion of a movement of traffic if the Agency is satisfied that no interchange exists within the maximum portion referred to in subsection (4).

###### No other rates may be established

(6) If a competitive line rate has been established for a movement of traffic of a shipper, no other competitive line rate may be established in respect of that movement while the rate is in effect.

###### Application to Agency to establish competitive line rates

**132.** (1) On the application of a shipper, the Agency shall, within forty-five days after receiving the application, establish any of the following matters in respect of which the shipper and the local carrier do not agree:

  * (_a_) the amount of the competitive line rate;

  * (_b_) the designation of the continuous route;

  * (_c_) the designation of the nearest interchange; and

  * (_d_) the manner in which the local carrier shall fulfil its service obligations.

###### No final offer arbitration

(2) If a matter is established by the Agency under this section, the shipper is not entitled to submit the matter to the Agency for final offer arbitration under section 161.

###### Competitive line rate

**133.** (1) A competitive line rate in respect of the movement of traffic of a shipper is the result obtained by applying the following formula:

A + (B/C × (D - E))

where

A 
    is the amount resulting from the application of the interswitching rate;
B 
    is the total revenue that the local carrier received in respect of all movement over its lines of railway

  * (_a_) of traffic that

    * (i) is the same as or substantially similar to, the traffic moved, and

    * (ii) is moved over similar distances, unless no such traffic is moved over similar distances; and

  * (_b_) during the most recent period designated by the local carrier or any other period determined by the Agency, if the Agency determines that the designated period is not appropriate in the circumstances;

C 
    is the total number of tonne kilometres of the movement of traffic that generated the total revenue;
D 
    is the number of kilometres over which the competitive line rate is to apply; and
E 
    is the total number of kilometres to which the interswitching rate is applicable.

###### Adjustment of rate

(2) If a shipper performs any of the activities in respect of which an interswitching rate is applicable, the applicable interswitching rate in the description of A in the formula must be adjusted to account for the performance of those activities.

###### Alternative determination

(3) The Agency may make an order in respect of a particular shipper or railway company, or make regulations that apply generally to shippers or railway companies, establishing an alternative method of determining the amount of a competitive line rate if the amount cannot be determined in accordance with this section.

###### Rate must be compensatory

(4) A competitive line rate determined under this section must not be less than the variable costs of moving the traffic, as determined by the Agency.

###### Rate to be included in tariff or confidential contract

**134.** A competitive line rate must be set out in a tariff or confidential contract.

###### Effective period of rate

**135.** If a competitive line rate is established by the Agency, it has effect for one year after its effective date, or for any other period that the shipper and the local carrier agree on.

###### Obligation of carriers to provide cars

**136.** (1) If a competitive line rate is established, a railway company, other than the local carrier, shall provide the shipper with an adequate supply of cars for the traffic being moved.

###### Additional obligations

(2) Subject to any agreement to the contrary between the local carrier and any connecting carrier concerned, the connecting carrier is responsible for

  * (_a_) a prorated share, determined in accordance with subsection (3), of the costs of operating and maintaining the interchange during the period in respect of which the competitive line rate is in effect; and

  * (_b_) the capital cost of making any change or addition to the interchange that may be necessary for transferring the traffic for which the competitive line rate is established.

###### Determination of prorated share

(3) The prorated share is the proportion that

  * (_a_) the competitive line rate traffic transferred at the interchange during the period

is of

  * (_b_) the total traffic transferred at the interchange during the period.

###### Tariff to set out service obligations

(4) The tariff setting out a competitive line rate must set out the manner in which the local carrier issuing the tariff shall, subject to subsection (1), fulfil its service obligations

  * (_a_) as agreed on by the shipper and the local carrier, if they agree on the amount of the competitive line rate; or

  * (_b_) as determined by the Agency, if the amount of the competitive line rate is established by the Agency under section 132.

### Limiting Carriers’ Liability
