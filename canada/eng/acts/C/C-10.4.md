## NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION POLICY

###### Declaration

**5.** It is declared that a competitive, economic and efficient national transportation system that meets the highest practicable safety and security standards and contributes to a sustainable environment and makes the best use of all modes of transportation at the lowest total cost is essential to serve the needs of its users, advance the well-being of Canadians and enable competitiveness and economic growth in both urban and rural areas throughout Canada. Those objectives are most likely to be achieved when

  * (_a_) competition and market forces, both within and among the various modes of transportation, are the prime agents in providing viable and effective transportation services;

  * (_b_) regulation and strategic public intervention are used to achieve economic, safety, security, environmental or social outcomes that cannot be achieved satisfactorily by competition and market forces and do not unduly favour, or reduce the inherent advantages of, any particular mode of transportation;

  * (_c_) rates and conditions do not constitute an undue obstacle to the movement of traffic within Canada or to the export of goods from Canada;

  * (_d_) the transportation system is accessible without undue obstacle to the mobility of persons, including persons with disabilities; and

  * (_e_) governments and the private sector work together for an integrated transportation system.

###### Order

(2) The Agency may order the railway companies to provide reasonable facilities for the convenient interswitching of traffic in both directions at an interchange between the lines of either railway and those of other railway companies connecting with them.

###### Interswitching limits

###### Extension of interswitching limits

(4) On the application of a person referred to in subsection (1), the Agency may deem a point of origin or destination of a movement of traffic in any particular case to be within 30 km, or a prescribed greater distance, of an interchange, if the Agency is of the opinion that, in the circumstances, the point of origin or destination is reasonably close to the interchange.

###### Regulations

  * (_a_) prescribing terms and conditions governing the interswitching of traffic, other than terms and conditions relating to safety;

###### Transferred railway lines

(2) For greater certainty, the transfer of a railway line, or an operating interest in it, under Division V or section 158 of the National Transportation Act, 1987 does not affect the right of a shipper to obtain a competitive line rate under sections 130 to 136.

###### When competitive line rate to be established on shipper’s request

**130.** (1) Subject to section 131, the local carrier serving the shipper at the point of origin or destination, as the case may be, shall, on the request of the shipper, establish a competitive line rate applicable to the movement of the traffic between the point of origin or destination, whichever is served exclusively by the local carrier, and the nearest interchange with a connecting carrier.

###### Requirement unaffected by extent of carrier’s capability

(2) The local carrier shall establish the competitive line rate even if it is able to move the traffic over the whole of the continuous route or a portion of that route that is longer than the portion in respect of which the competitive line rate is to apply.

###### Designation of route by shipper

(3) The shipper may designate the continuous route for the movement of the shipper’s traffic from the point of origin to the point of destination.

###### Route within Canada

(4) If the ultimate point of destination of a movement of the shipper’s traffic is in Canada, the shipper shall designate a route wholly within Canada, unless there is no cost-effective continuous route wholly within Canada that is available to the shipper and over which it is reasonable to move the shipper’s traffic.

###### Export and import

(5) For the purposes of this section,

  * (_a_) if the point of destination of a movement of traffic is a port in Canada for export out of Canada, that port is the ultimate point of destination in Canada; and

  * (_b_) if the point of origin of a movement of traffic is a port in Canada for import into Canada, that port is the point of origin.

###### Nearest interchange

(6) For the purposes of subsection (1), the nearest interchange is the one nearest the point of origin or destination, whichever is served exclusively by the local carrier, in the reasonable direction of the movement of the traffic from the point of origin to the point of destination on the continuous route designated by the shipper, unless the local carrier can demonstrate that the interchange cannot be used for engineering reasons.

###### Shipper and connecting carriers must agree

**131.** (1) A competitive line rate must not be established unless the shipper agrees with the connecting carrier, and with any other company, other than the local carrier, that moves traffic over a portion of the continuous route, on the terms and conditions governing their movement of the traffic, including the applicable rate.

###### No other rate applies

(2) If an interswitching rate determined under paragraph 128(1)(_b_) is available for a portion of the route operated by the local carrier, no other rate may be applied to that portion of the route.

###### Movement on flat cars or less than carload traffic

(3) A competitive line rate must not be established for the movement of trailers on flat cars, containers on flat cars or less than carload traffic, unless they arrive at a port in Canada by water for movement by rail or by rail for movement by water.

###### Maximum portion of traffic

(4) The portion of a movement of traffic in respect of which a competitive line rate may be established must not exceed 50 per cent of the total number of kilometres over which the traffic is moved by rail or 1 200 km, whichever is greater.

###### Exception

(5) On application of a shipper, the Agency may establish a competitive line rate for a greater portion of a movement of traffic if the Agency is satisfied that no interchange exists within the maximum portion referred to in subsection (4).

###### No other rates may be established

(6) If a competitive line rate has been established for a movement of traffic of a shipper, no other competitive line rate may be established in respect of that movement while the rate is in effect.

###### Application to Agency to establish competitive line rates
