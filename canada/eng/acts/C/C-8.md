## DIVISION B - CALCULATION OF BENEFITS

### Basic Amount and Annual Adjustment

###### Basic amount of benefit

**45.** (1) A reference in this Part to the basic amount of any benefit shall be construed as a reference to the amount thereof calculated as provided in this Part without regard to subsection (2).

###### Annual adjustments

(2) Where any benefit has become payable commencing with a month in any year, the basic monthly amount of the benefit shall be adjusted annually, in prescribed manner, so that the amount payable for a month in any following year is an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying

  * (_a_) the amount that would have been payable for that month if no adjustment had been made under this section with respect to that following year,

by

  * (_b_) the ratio that the Pension Index for that following year bears to the Pension Index for the year preceding that following year.

  * R.S., 1985, c. C-8, s. 45;
  * R.S., 1985, c. 30 (2nd Supp.), s. 14.

### Retirement Pension

###### Amount of retirement pension

**46.** (1) Subject to this section, a retirement pension payable to a contributor is a basic monthly amount equal to twenty-five per cent of his average monthly pensionable earnings.

###### Special case

(2) Subject to this section, the basic monthly amount of a retirement pension payable to a former disability pension recipient in respect of whom a division of unadjusted pensionable earnings is approved either before or after the commencement of the retirement pension, where the division reduces the retirement pension otherwise payable, shall be calculated by dividing

  * (_a_) the aggregate of

    * (i) the basic monthly amount of the retirement pension calculated in subsection (1) that would be payable to the contributor had his unadjusted pensionable earnings not been subject to the division, multiplied by the number of months that have been excluded from the contributor’s contributory period by reason of disability, and

    * (ii) the basic monthly amount of the retirement pension calculated in subsection (1) that would be payable following the division, multiplied by the number of months in the contributor’s contributory period calculated in accordance with section 49

by

  * (_b_) the aggregate of

    * (i) the number of months that have been excluded from the contributor’s contributory period by reason of disability, and

    * (ii) the number of months in the contributor’s contributory period calculated in accordance with section 49.

###### Upward or downward adjustment factor

(3) Subject to subsections (4) to (6), a retirement pension that becomes payable after December 31, 1986 commencing with a month other than the month in which the contributor reaches sixty-five years of age is a basic monthly amount equal to the basic monthly amount calculated in subsection (1) or (2), as the case may be, adjusted by a factor fixed by the Minister, on the advice of the Chief Actuary of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, to reflect the time interval between the month in which the retirement pension commences and the month in which the contributor reached, or would reach, sixty-five years of age, but such time interval shall be deemed never to exceed five years.

###### Exception where division of unadjusted pensionable earnings increases retirement pension

(4) Subject to subsection (5), where, as a result of a division of unadjusted pensionable earnings pursuant to section 55 or 55.1, a retirement pension that was payable increases, the adjustment factor applicable thereafter to the basic monthly amount of the retirement pension calculated in subsection (1) or (2), as the case may be, in lieu of the adjustment factor under subsection (3), shall be determined by the formula

[(F1 × P1) + (F2 × E)]/P2

where

  * _a_) “F1” is an amount equal to the adjustment factor under subsection (3) at the time the retirement pension first became payable;

  * (_b_) “P1” is the basic monthly amount of the retirement pension calculated in subsection (1) or (2), as the case may be, before the division;

  * (_c_) “F2 ”is the lesser of 

    * (i) an amount equal to what the adjustment factor under subsection (3) would have been if the retirement pension had commenced in the month in which the increase commences to be payable, and

    * (ii) 1;

  * (_d_) “E” is equal to the excess of P2 over P1; and

  * (_e_) “P2” is the basic monthly amount of the retirement pension immediately following the division.

###### Exception where survivor’s pension reduced

(5) Except where otherwise provided by an agreement under section 80, where a person is in receipt of a retirement pension under this Act and a survivor’s pension under this Act and the survivor’s pension is at any time reduced from its full amount pursuant to subsection 58(2), any downward adjustment factor resulting from the application of subsection (3) or (4) at that time shall not be applied to the whole of the basic monthly amount of the retirement pension calculated in subsection (1) or (2), as the case may be, but only to the amount remaining when that basic monthly amount is reduced by the product obtained by multiplying

  * (_a_) the amount by which the survivor’s pension has been reduced

by

  * (_b_) the ratio that the Pension Index for the year in which the retirement pension first commenced to be payable bears to the Pension Index for the year in which the survivor’s pension is reduced.

###### Exception where division after age 65 precedes commencement of retirement pension

(6) Where, after a person has reached sixty-five years of age but before the person commences to receive a retirement pension, a division of unadjusted pensionable earnings takes place under section 55 or 55.1 in respect of that person, the upward adjustment factor under subsection (3) to be applied to any increase in the retirement pension that is attributable to the division shall be based on the time interval between the taking place of the division and the commencement of the retirement pension, and shall not take into account the time interval between the month in which the person reaches sixty-five years of age and the month in which the division takes place.

  * 1991, c. 44, s. 5.

###### Amount of average monthly pensionable earnings

**47.** Where a retirement pension becomes payable to a contributor commencing with any month before January, 1976, his average monthly pensionable earnings are an amount calculated by dividing his total pensionable earnings by the basic number of contributory months.

  * R.S., c. C-5, s. 47.

###### Average monthly pensionable earnings in case of pension commencing after December, 1975

**48.** (1) Subject to subsections (2), (3) and (4), where a retirement pension becomes payable to a contributor commencing with any month after December, 1975, his average monthly pensionable earnings are an amount calculated by dividing his total pensionable earnings by the total number of months in his contributory period or by the basic number of contributory months, whichever is the greater.

###### Deductions in calculating average monthly pensionable earnings of certain months during child raising years

(2) In calculating the average monthly pensionable earnings of a contributor in accordance with subsection (1) for the purpose of calculating or recalculating benefits payable for a month commencing on or after January 1, 1978, there may be deducted

  * (_a_) from the total number of months in a contributor’s contributory period, those months during which he was a family allowance recipient and during which his pensionable earnings were less than his average monthly pensionable earnings calculated without regard to subsections (3) and (4), but no such deduction shall reduce the number of months in his contributory period to less than the basic number of contributory months, except

    * (i) for the purpose of calculating a disability benefit in respect of a contributor who is deemed to have become disabled for the purposes of this Act after December 31, 1997, in which case the words “the basic number of contributory months” shall be read as “48 months”,

(3) Where a contributor’s contributory period ends after the month preceding the month in which he reaches sixty-five years of age and the total number of months in his contributory period remaining after the deduction under paragraph (2)(_a_) exceeds the basic number of contributory months, in calculating his average monthly pensionable earnings in accordance with subsection (1) there shall be deducted

  * (_a_) from the total number of months remaining in his contributory period, the number of months therein after he reached sixty-five years of age or by which the total exceeds the basic number of contributory months, whichever is the lesser; and

  * (_b_) from his total pensionable earnings remaining after the deduction under paragraph (2)(_b_), the aggregate of his pensionable earnings for a number of months equal to the number of months deducted under paragraph (_a_), for which months that aggregate is less than the aggregate of his pensionable earnings for any other like number of months in his contributory period other than for months for which a deduction has already been made under subsection (2).

###### Deductions allowed where number of months remaining exceeds 120

(4) Where the number of months remaining after making any deduction under subsection (2) or (3) from the total number of months in the contributory period of a contributor exceeds one hundred and twenty, in calculating his average monthly pensionable earnings in accordance with subsection (1) there shall be deducted

  * (_a_) from the number of months so remaining, a number of months equal to

    * (i) fifteen per cent of the number so remaining, and if that fifteen per cent includes a fraction of a month, the fraction shall be taken to be a complete month,

or

    * (ii) the number of months by which the number so remaining exceeds one hundred and twenty,

whichever is lesser; and

  * (_b_) from his total pensionable earnings remaining after making any deduction under subsection (2) or (3), the aggregate of his pensionable earnings for a number of months equal to the number of months deducted under paragraph (_a_), for which months that aggregate is less than his aggregate pensionable earnings for any like number of months in his contributory period other than for months for which a deduction has already been made under subsection (2) or (3).

(C/D) × (E/F)

where

C

A/B

where

A 
    is the average for the twelve month period ending on June 30 of the year preceding that particular year of the average weekly wages and salaries of the Industrial Composite in Canada as published by Statistics Canada for each month in that period, and
B 
    is the average for the twelve month period ending on June 30, 1985 of the average weekly wages and salaries of the Industrial Composite in Canada as published by Statistics Canada for each month in that period.

  * (_a_) for a year in which the contributor reaches eighteen years of age or in which a disability pension ceases to be payable to him under this Act or under a provincial pension plan, the contribution shall be deemed to have been made for earnings for the months in the year after he reached that age or after the pension ceased to be payable, as the case may be, and

  * (_b_) for a year in which the contributor reaches seventy years of age or dies, in which a retirement pension becomes payable to him under this Act or under a provincial pension plan or in which any month is excluded from his contributory period under this Act or under a provincial pension plan by reason of disability, the contribution shall be deemed to have been made for earnings for the months in the year before the contributor reached seventy years of age or died, before the retirement pension became payable or that were not so excluded, as the case may be,

in which case the earnings for which he shall be deemed to have made a contribution for each such month shall be an amount calculated by dividing his unadjusted pensionable earnings for that year by the number of those months.

###### Saving

(6.1) Where subsection (6) applies and the aggregate amount of the survivor’s pension and the disability pension are less than the amount of the disability pension that would be payable if the survivor’s pension were not payable, the amount of the disability pension is the amount that results when

  * (_a_) the amount of the survivor’s pension

is subtracted from

  * (_b_) the amount of the disability pension that would be payable if the survivor’s pension were not payable.

###### Calculation of disability pension where survivor’s pension payable

(6.2) Where a survivor’s pension under this Act and a disability pension under this Act are payable to the survivor of a contributor and subsection (6) does not apply, the amount of the disability pension is an amount that, when added to the amount of the survivor’s pension for a month in the year in which the survivor’s pension or the disability pension commenced to be payable, whichever is the later, equals the aggregate of
