S.C. 2002, c. 18

Assented to 2002-06-13

An Act respecting the national marine conservation areas of Canada

###### Preamble

Whereas the protection of natural, self-regulating marine ecosystems is important for the maintenance of biological diversity;

Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to adopting the precautionary principle in the conservation and management of the marine environment so that, where there are threats of environmental damage, lack of scientific certainty is not used as a reason for postponing preventive measures;

And whereas Parliament wishes to affirm the need to

establish a system of marine conservation areas that are representative of the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific Oceans and the Great Lakes and are of sufficient extent and such configuration as to maintain healthy marine ecosystems,

ensure that Canada contributes to international efforts for the establishment of a worldwide network of representative marine protected areas,

consider implications for ecosystems in the planning and management of marine conservation areas so established,

provide opportunities for the people of Canada and of the world to appreciate and enjoy Canada’s natural and cultural marine heritage,

recognize that the marine environment is fundamental to the social, cultural and economic well-being of people living in coastal communities,

provide opportunities, through the zoning of marine conservation areas, for the ecologically sustainable use of marine resources for the lasting benefit of coastal communities,

promote an understanding of the marine environment and provide opportunities for research and monitoring,

consider traditional ecological knowledge in the planning and management of marine conservation areas, and

involve federal and provincial ministers and agencies, affected coastal communities, aboriginal organizations, aboriginal governments, bodies established under land claims agreements and other appropriate persons and bodies in the effort to establish and maintain the representative system of marine conservation areas;

NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
