(_a_) Each Partner State agrees to a cross-waiver of liability pursuant to which each Partner State waives all claims against any of the entities or persons listed in subparagraphs 3(_a_)(1) through 3(_a_)(3) below based on damage arising out of Protected Space Operations. This cross-waiver shall apply only if the person, entity, or property causing the damage is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected Space Operations. The cross-waiver shall apply to any claims for damage, whatever the legal basis for such claims against:

      * (1) another Partner State;

      * (2) a related entity of another Partner State;

      * (3) the employees of any of the entities identified in subparagraphs 3(_a_)(1) and 3(_a_)(2) above.

    * (_b_) In addition, each Partner State shall, by contract or otherwise, extend the cross-waiver of liability as set forth in subparagraph 3(_a_) above to its related entities by requiring them to:

      * (1) waive all claims against the entities or persons identified in subparagraphs 3(_a_)(1) through 3(_a_)(3) above; and

      * (2) require that their related entities waive all claims against the entities or persons identified in subparagraphs 3(_a_)(1) through 3(_a_)(3) above.

    * (_c_) For avoidance of doubt, this cross-waiver of liability includes a cross-waiver of liability arising from the Liability Convention where the person, entity, or property causing the damage is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected Space Operations.

    * (_d_) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, this cross-waiver of liability shall not be applicable to:

      * (1) claims between a Partner State and its related entity or between its own related entities;

      * (2) claims made by a natural person, his/her estate, survivors or subrogees (except when a subrogee is a Partner State) for bodily injury to, or other impairment of health of, or death of such natural person;

      * (3) claims for damage caused by willful misconduct;

      * (4) intellectual property claims;

      * (5) claims for damage resulting from a failure of a Partner State to extend the cross-waiver of liability to its related entities, pursuant to subparagraph 3(_b_) above.

    * (_e_) With respect to subparagraph 3(_d_)(2) above, in the event that a subrogated claim of the Government of Japan is not based upon government employee accident compensation law, the Government of Japan shall fulfill its obligation to waive such subrogated claim by ensuring that any assisting entity specified pursuant to subparagraph 2(_a_) above indemnifies, in a manner consistent with Article 15(2) and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of Japan, any entity or person identified in subparagraphs 3(_a_)(1) through 3(_a_)(3) above against liability arising from such subrogated claim by the Government of Japan. Nothing in this Article shall preclude the Government of Japan from waiving the foregoing subrogated claims.

    * (_f_) Nothing in this Article shall be construed to create the basis for a claim or suit where none would otherwise exist.

### ARTICLE 17  
Liability Convention

  * 1. Except as otherwise provided in Article 16, the Partner States, as well as ESA, shall remain liable in accordance with the Liability Convention.

  * 2. In the event of a claim arising out of the Liability Convention, the Partners (and ESA, if appropriate) shall consult promptly on any potential liability, on any apportionment of such liability, and on the defense of such claim.

  * 3. Regarding the provision of launch and return services provided for in Article 12(2), the Partners concerned (and ESA, if appropriate) may conclude separate agreements regarding the apportionment of any potential joint and several liability arising out of the Liability Convention.

### ARTICLE 18  
Customs and Immigration

  * 1. Each Partner State shall facilitate the movement of persons and goods necessary to implement this Agreement into and out of its territory, subject to its laws and regulations.

  * 2. Subject to its laws and regulations, each Partner State shall facilitate provision of the appropriate entry and residence documentation for nationals and families of nationals of another Partner State who enter or exit or reside within the territory of the first Partner State in order to carry out functions necessary for the implementation of this Agreement.

  * 3. Each Partner State shall grant permission for duty-free importation and exportation to and from its territory of goods and software which are necessary for implementation of this Agreement and shall ensure their exemption from any other taxes and duties collected by the customs authorities. This paragraph shall be implemented without regard to the country of origin of such necessary goods and software.

### ARTICLE 19  
Exchange of Data and Goods

  * 1. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, each Partner, acting through its Cooperating Agency shall transfer all technical data and goods considered to be necessary (by both parties to any transfer) to fulfill the responsibilities of that Partner’s Cooperating Agency under the relevant MOUs and implementing arrangements. Each Partner undertakes to handle expeditiously any request for technical data or goods presented by the Cooperating Agency of another Partner for the purposes of Space Station cooperation. This Article shall not require a Partner State to transfer any technical data and goods in contravention of its national laws or regulations.

  * 2. The Partners shall make their best efforts to handle expeditiously requests for authorization of transfers of technical data and goods by persons or entities other than the Partners or their Cooperating Agencies (for example, company-to-company exchanges which are likely to develop), and they shall encourage and facilitate such transfers in connection with the Space Station cooperation under this Agreement. Otherwise, such transfers are not covered by the terms and conditions of this Article. National laws and regulations shall apply to such transfers.

  * 3. The Partners agree that transfers of technical data and goods under this Agreement shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in this paragraph. The transfer of technical data for the purposes of discharging the Partners’ responsibilities with regard to interface, integration and safety shall normally be made without the restrictions set forth in this paragraph. If detailed design, manufacturing, and processing data and associated software is necessary for interface, integration or safety purposes, the transfer shall be made in accordance with paragraph 1 above, but the data and associated software may be appropriately marked as set out below. Technical data and goods not covered by the restrictions set forth in this paragraph shall be transferred without restriction, except as otherwise restricted by national laws or regulations.

    * (_a_) The furnishing Cooperating Agency shall mark with a notice, or otherwise specifically identify, the technical data or goods that are to be protected for export control purposes. Such a notice or identification shall indicate any specific conditions regarding how such technical data or goods may be used by the receiving Cooperating Agency and its contractors and subcontractors, including

      * (1) that such technical data or goods shall be used only for the purposes of fulfilling the receiving Cooperating Agency’s responsibilities under this Agreement and the relevant MOUs, and

      * (2) that such technical data or goods shall not be used by persons or entities other than the receiving Cooperating Agency, its contractors or subcontractors, or for any other purposes, without the prior written permission of the furnishing Partner State, acting through its Cooperating Agency.

    * (_b_) The furnishing Cooperating Agency shall mark with a notice the technical data that are to be protected for proprietary rights purposes. Such notice shall indicate any specific conditions regarding how such technical data may be used by the receiving Cooperating Agency and its contractors and subcontractors, including

      * (1) that such technical data shall be used, duplicated, or disclosed only for the purposes of fulfilling the receiving Cooperating Agency’s responsibilities under this Agreement and the relevant MOUs, and

      * (2) that such technical data shall not be used by persons or entities other than the receiving Cooperating Agency, its contractors or subcontractors, or for any other purposes, without the prior written permission of the furnishing Partner State, acting through its Cooperating Agency.

    * (_c_) In the event that any technical data or goods transferred under this Agreement are classified, the furnishing Cooperating Agency shall mark with a notice, or otherwise specifically identify, such technical data or goods. The requested Partner State may require that any such transfer shall be pursuant to a security of information agreement or arrangement which sets forth the conditions for transferring and protecting such technical data or goods. A transfer need not be conducted if the receiving Partner State does not provide for the protection of the secrecy of patent applications containing information that is classified or otherwise held in secrecy for national security purposes. No classified technical data or goods shall be transferred under this Agreement unless both parties agree to the transfer.

  * 4. Each Partner State shall take all necessary steps to ensure that technical data or goods received by it under subparagraphs 3(_a_), 3(_b_), or 3(_c_) above shall be treated by the receiving Partner States, its Cooperating Agency, and other persons and entities (including contractors and subcontractors) to which the technical data or goods are subsequently transferred in accordance with the terms of the notice or identification. Each Partner State and Cooperating Agency shall take all reasonably necessary steps, including ensuring appropriate contractual conditions in their contracts and subcontracts, to prevent unauthorized use, disclosure, or retransfer of, or unauthorized access to, such technical data or goods. In the case of technical data or goods received under subparagraph 3(_c_) above, the receiving Partner State or Cooperating Agency shall accord such technical data or goods a level of protection at least equivalent to the level of protection accorded by the furnishing Partner State or Cooperating Agency.

  * 5. It is not the intent of the Partners to grant, through this Agreement or the relevant MOUs, any rights to a recipient beyond the right to use, disclose, or retransfer received technical data or goods consistent with conditions imposed under this Article.

  * 6. Withdrawal from this Agreement by a Partner State shall not affect rights or obligations regarding the protection of technical data and goods transferred under this Agreement prior to such withdrawal, unless otherwise agreed in a withdrawal agreement pursuant to Article 28.

  * 7. For the purposes of this Article, any transfer of technical data and goods by a Cooperating Agency to ESA shall be deemed to be destined to ESA, to all of the European Partner States, and to ESA’s designated Space Station contractors and subcontractors, unless otherwise specifically provided for at the time of transfer.

  * 8. The Partners, through their Cooperating Agencies, will establish guidelines for security of information.

### ARTICLE 20  
Treatment of Data and Goods in Transit

Recognizing the importance of the continuing operation and full international utilization of the Space Station, each Partner State shall, to the extent its applicable laws and regulations permit, allow the expeditious transit of data and goods of the other Partners, their Cooperating Agencies, and their users. This Article shall only apply to data and goods transiting to and from the Space Station, including but not limited to transit between its national border and a launch or landing site within its territory, and between a launch or landing site and the Space Station.

### ARTICLE 21  
Intellectual Property

  * 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, “intellectual property” is understood to have the meaning of Article 2 of the Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization, done at Stockholm on 14 July 1967.

  * 2. Subject to the provisions of this Article, for purposes of intellectual property law, an activity occurring in or on a Space Station flight element shall be deemed to have occurred only in the territory of the Partner State of that element’s registry, except that for ESA-registered elements any European Partner State may deem the activity to have occurred within its territory. For avoidance of doubt, participation by a Partner State, its Cooperating Agency, or its related entities in an activity occurring in or on any other Partner’s Space Station flight element shall not in and of itself alter or affect the jurisdiction over such activity provided for in the previous sentence.

  * 3. In respect of an invention made in or on any Space Station flight element by a person who is not its national or resident, a Partner State shall not apply its laws concerning secrecy of inventions so as to prevent the filing of a patent application (for example, by imposing a delay or requiring prior authorization) in any other Partner State that provides for the protection of the secrecy of patent applications containing information that is classified or otherwise protected for national security purposes. This provision does not prejudice

    * (_a_) the right of any Partner State in which a patent application is first filed to control the secrecy of such patent application or restrict its further filing; or

    * (_b_) the right of any other Partner State in which an application is subsequently filed to restrict, pursuant to any international obligation, the dissemination of an application.

  * 4. Where a person or entity owns intellectual property which is protected in more than one European Partner State, that person or entity may not recover in more than one such State for the same act of infringement of the same rights in such intellectual property which occurs in or on an ESA-registered element. Where the same act of infringement in or on an ESA-registered element gives rise to actions by different intellectual property owners by virtue of more than one European Partner State’s deeming the activity to have occurred in its territory, a court may grant a temporary stay of proceeding in a later-filed action pending the outcome of an earlier-filed action. Where more than one action is brought, satisfaction of a judgment rendered for damages in any of the actions shall bar further recovery of damages in any pending or future action for infringement based upon the same act of infringement.

  * 5. With respect to an activity occurring in or on an ESA-registered element, no European Partner State shall refuse to recognize a license for the exercise of any intellectual property right if that license is enforceable under the laws of any European Partner State, and compliance with the provisions of such license shall also bar recovery for infringement in any European Partner State.

  * 6. The temporary presence in the territory of a Partner State of any articles, including the components of a flight element, in transit between any place on Earth and any flight element of the Space Station registered by another Partner State or ESA shall not in itself form the basis for any proceedings in the first Partner State for patent infringement.

### ARTICLE 22  
Criminal Jurisdiction

In view of the unique and unprecedented nature of this particular international cooperation in space:

  * 1. Canada, the European Partner States, Japan, Russia, and the United States may exercise criminal jurisdiction over personnel in or on any flight element who are their respective nationals.

  * 2. In a case involving misconduct on orbit that:

    * (_a_) affects the life or safety of a national of another Partner State, or

    * (_b_) occurs in or on or causes damage to the flight element of another Partner State, the Partner State whose national is the alleged perpetrator shall, at the request of any affected Partner State, consult with such State concerning their respective prosecutorial interests. An affected Partner State may, following such consultation, exercise criminal jurisdiction over the alleged perpetrator provided that, within 90 days of the date of such consultation or within such other period as may be mutually agreed, the Partner State whose national is the alleged perpetrator either:

      * (1) concurs in such exercise of criminal jurisdiction, or

      * (2) fails to provide assurances that it will submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution.

  * 3. If a Partner State which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another Partner State with which it has no extradition treaty, it may at its option consider this Agreement as the legal basis for extradition in respect of the alleged misconduct on orbit. Extradition shall be subject to the procedural provisions and the other conditions of the law of the requested Partner State.

  * 4. Each Partner State shall, subject to its national laws and regulations, afford the other Partners assistance in connection with alleged misconduct on orbit.

  * 5. This Article is not intended to limit the authorities and procedures for the maintenance of order and the conduct of crew activities in or on the Space Station which shall be established in the Code of Conduct pursuant to Article 11, and the Code of Conduct is not intended to limit the application of this Article.

### ARTICLE 23  
Consultations

  * 1. The Partners, acting through their Cooperating Agencies, may consult with each other on any matter arising out of Space Station cooperation. The Partners shall exert their best efforts to settle such matters through consultation between or among their Cooperating Agencies in accordance with procedures provided in the MOUs.

  * 2. Any Partner may request that government-level consultations be held with another Partner on any matter arising out of Space Station cooperation. The requested Partner shall accede to such request promptly. If the requesting Partner notifies the United States that the subject of such consultations is appropriate for consideration by all the Partners, the United States shall convene multilateral consultations at the earliest practicable time, to which it shall invite all the Partners.

  * 3. Any Partner which intends to proceed with significant flight element design changes which may have an impact on the other Partners shall notify the other Partners accordingly at the earliest opportunity. A Partner so notified may request that the matter be submitted to consultations in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 above.

  * 4. If an issue not resolved through consultations still needs to be resolved, the concerned Partners may submit that issue to an agreed form of dispute resolution such as conciliation, mediation, or arbitration.

### ARTICLE 24  
Space Station Cooperation Review

In view of the long-term, complex, and evolving character of their cooperation under this Agreement, the Partners shall keep each other informed of developments which might affect this cooperation. Beginning in 1999, and every three years thereafter, the Partners shall meet to deal with matters involved in their cooperation and to review and promote Space Station cooperation.

### ARTICLE 25

    * (_b_) This Agreement shall not enter into force for a European Partner State before it enters into force for the European Partner. It shall enter into force for the European Partner after the Depositary receives instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval, or accession from at least four European signatory or acceding States, and, in addition, a formal notification by the Chairman of the ESA Council.

    * (_c_) Following entry into force of this Agreement for the European Partner, it shall enter into force for any European State listed in the Preamble that has not deposited its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval upon deposit of such instrument. Any ESA Member State not listed in the Preamble may accede to this Agreement by depositing its instrument of accession with the Depositary.

  * 4. Upon entry into force of this Agreement, the 1988 Agreement shall cease to be in force.

  * 5. If this Agreement has not entered into force for a Partner within a period of two years after its signature, the United States may convene a conference of the signatories to this Agreement to consider what steps, including any modifications to this Agreement, are necessary to take account of that circumstance.

## ARTICLE 26
