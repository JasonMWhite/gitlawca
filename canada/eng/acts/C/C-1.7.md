  * (_a_) that the insider reasonably believed that the information had been generally disclosed;

  * (_b_) that the information was known, or ought reasonably to have been known, to the person who alleges to have suffered the damages;

  * (_c_) that the disclosure of the information was necessary in the course of the business of the insider, except if the insider is a person described in subsection (2) or (2.1); or

  * (_a_) if the plaintiff is a purchaser, the price paid by the plaintiff for the security less the average market price of the security over the twenty trading days immediately following general disclosure of the information; and

  * (_b_) if the plaintiff is a seller, the average market price of the security over the twenty trading days immediately following general disclosure of the information, less the price that the plaintiff received for the security.

###### Liability

(9) If more than one insider is liable under subsection (4) or (6) with respect to the same transaction or series of transactions, their liability is joint and several, or solidary.

###### Limitation

(10) An action to enforce a right created by subsections (4) to (7) may be commenced only within two years after discovery of the facts that gave rise to the cause of action.

**191.** A cooperative must treat a person, other than one described in section 190, as being entitled to exercise the rights and privileges attached to a security if the person provides proof that the person has acquired ownership of the security by operation of law or has legal authority to exercise the rights and privileges.

###### Joint owners

**192.** If satisfactory proof of the death of a joint holder of a security is provided to a cooperative, it may treat any surviving joint holders as the owner of the security.

###### Duties of cooperative

**193.** A cooperative is not required to inquire into the existence of, or see to the performance of, any duty owed to a third person by a registered holder or a person who may be treated as a registered holder of a security.

###### Minors

**194.** If an individual who is less than 18 years of age exercises a right of ownership in a security of a cooperative, no subsequent repudiation or avoidance or, in Quebec, annulment or reduction of obligations is effective against the cooperative.

  * 2011, c. 21, s. 92.

###### Deceased owner

**195.** (1) Subject to any applicable law relating to the collection of taxes, a person who is an heir or a fiduciary of an estate or succession of a deceased security holder is entitled to become the registered holder or to designate a registered holder if the person deposits the following information with the cooperative or its transfer agent, together with any reasonable assurances that the cooperative may require:

  * (_a_) the security certificate or, in default of one, a document proving that the deceased was the security holder;

  * (_b_) a document proving the death of the security holder; and

  * (_c_) a document proving that the heir or fiduciary has the right under the law of the place in which the deceased was domiciled immediately before their death to deal with the security.

###### Endorsement

(2) A security certificate referred to in paragraph (1)(_a_) must be endorsed

  * (_a_) in the case of a transfer to an heir or fiduciary, by that person; and

  * (_b_) in any other case, in a manner acceptable to the cooperative.

###### Right of cooperative

(3) Deposit of the documents required by subsection (1) empowers a cooperative or its transfer agent to record in a securities register the transmission of a security from the deceased holder to the heir or fiduciary or to any person that the heir or fiduciary may designate and to treat the person who becomes a registered holder as the owner of the securities.

###### Overissue

**196.** (1) Subject to this section, the provisions of this Part that validate a security or compel its issue or reissue do not apply if the validation, issue or reissue of a security would result in overissue.

###### Identical security

(2) The person who is entitled to a validation or issue may, if there has been an overissue and if a valid security that is similar in all respects to the security involved in the overissue is reasonably available for purchase, compel the issuer to purchase and deliver that security against the surrender of the security that the person holds.

###### If identical security not available

(3) If a valid security that is similar in all respects to the security involved in the overissue is not reasonably available for purchase, the person who is entitled to the validation or issue may recover from the issuer an amount equal to the price the last purchaser for value paid for the invalid security.

###### Increase in capital

(4) The overissued securities are valid from the date they were issued only if the issuer increases the number of its authorized securities to a number equal to or greater than the number of securities previously authorized plus the number of the securities overissued.

###### Exemptions

**197.** Sections 147 to 149 and 152 do not apply to a payment or purchase by an issuer under section 196.

## Proceedings

###### Rules of action

**198.** The following rules apply in an action on a security:

  * (_a_) each signature on the security certificate or in a necessary endorsement is admitted unless specifically denied in the pleadings;

  * (_b_) a signature on the security is presumed to be genuine and authorized but, if the effectiveness of the signature is in issue, the burden of establishing that it is genuine and authorized is on the party claiming under the signature;

  * (_c_) if a signature is admitted or established, production of a certificate entitles the holder to recover on it unless the other party establishes a defence or defect going to the validity of the security; and

  * (_d_) if the other party establishes the defence or defect, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the defect is ineffective against the plaintiff or some other person under whom the claim is made.

## Delivery

###### Purchaser without notice

(2) Subsection (1) applies to a good faith purchaser but the incorporation by reference is itself not notice of a defect to the purchaser even if the security expressly states that a person accepting it admits that notice.

  * 1998, c. 1, s. 200;
  * 2011, c. 21, s. 93(E).

###### Validity of security

**201.** A security is valid in the hands of a good faith purchaser.

###### Defence

**202.** Subject to section 205, the fact that a security is not genuine is a complete defence even against a good faith purchaser.

###### Defences

**203.** All other defences of an issuer, including non-delivery and conditional delivery of a security, are ineffective against a good faith purchaser.

###### Deemed notice

**204.** (1) A purchaser is deemed to have notice of any defect in the issue of a security or any defence of the issuer if the security becomes stale within the meaning of subsection (2).

###### Stale security

###### Unauthorized signature

**205.** (1) Subject to subsection (2), an unauthorized signature on a security is ineffective.

  * (_b_) an employee of the issuer or a person referred to in paragraph (_a_) who handles the security in the ordinary course of their duties.

###### Completion of form

**206.** If a security contains the signatures necessary for its issue or transfer but is incomplete in another respect, any person may complete it in accordance with their authority.

###### Enforceability

**207.** A security that was completed incorrectly is enforceable by a good faith purchaser.

###### Fraud

**208.** A completed security that was improperly altered, even if fraudulently altered, remains enforceable but only according to its original terms.

###### Guarantees

**209.** (1) A person signing a security as an authenticating trustee, transfer agent or other person entrusted by the issuer with the duty to sign the security guarantees to a good faith purchaser that

  * (_a_) the security is genuine;

(2) A good faith purchaser of a security acquires it free from any adverse claim.

###### No better position

(3) A purchaser who was a party to a fraud or illegality affecting a security or who, as a prior holder, had notice of an adverse claim does not have a better position by taking from a later good faith purchaser.

**211.** A purchaser acquires rights only to the extent of the interest or right purchased.

  * 1998, c. 1, s. 211;
  * 2011, c. 21, s. 94(E).

**212.** (1) A purchaser of a security, or a broker for a seller or purchaser, is deemed to have notice of an adverse claim if

  * (_a_) the security has been endorsed “for collection” or “for surrender” or for some other purpose other than transfer; or

  * (_b_) the security is in bearer form and has a statement on it that it belongs to a person other than the transferor.

###### Name

(2) The mere writing of a name on a security is not a statement for the purposes of paragraph (1)(_b_).

###### No duty to inquire

**213.** (1) A purchaser of a security, or a broker for a seller or purchaser, has no duty to inquire into the rightfulness of the transfer and, subject to section 214, has no notice of an adverse claim.

###### Staleness

**215.** (1) The following events do not constitute notice of an adverse claim except if the security becomes stale within the meaning of subsection (2):

  * (_a_) an event that creates a right to performance of the principal obligation evidenced by the security; or

  * (_b_) an event that sets the date on or after which the security is to be presented or surrendered for redemption or exchange.

###### Staleness of security

(2) A security becomes stale if

  * (_a_) the purchaser takes the security more than one year after

  * (_a_) the transfer is effective and rightful;

  * (_b_) the security is genuine and has not been materially altered; and

  * (_c_) the person knows of nothing that might impair the validity of the security.

###### Guarantee of intermediary

**218.** An intermediary delivering a security to a purchaser who knows that the intermediary is an intermediary guarantees only good faith.

###### Guarantee of broker

**219.** A broker gives to a customer, to the issuer and to a purchaser the guarantees provided in sections 216 to 218 and has the rights and privileges of a purchaser under those sections, and those guarantees of and in favour of the broker acting as an agent or mandatary are in addition to guarantees given by the customer and guarantees given in favour of the customer.

###### Right to compel endorsement

**220.** If a registered security is delivered to a purchaser without a necessary endorsement, the purchaser has the right to demand the endorsement. The purchaser becomes a good faith purchaser after the endorsement.

Definition of “appropriate”

**221.** (1) In this section, section 222, subsections 229(1) and 237(1) and section 241, “appropriate”, with respect to a person, means that the person is

  * (_a_) the person who is specified by the security or by a special endorsement to be entitled to the security;

  * (_b_) if a person described in paragraph (_a_) is described as a fiduciary but is no longer serving as one, either that person or their successor;

  * (_c_) if the security or endorsement mentioned in paragraph (_a_) specifies more than one person as fiduciaries and one or more of those persons is no longer a fiduciary, the remaining fiduciary or fiduciaries, whether or not a successor has been appointed or qualified;

  * (_d_) if a person described in paragraph (_a_) is an individual and is without capacity to act by reason of death, incompetence, minority or other incapacity, the person’s fiduciary;

  * (_e_) if the security or endorsement mentioned in paragraph (_a_) specifies more than one person with right of survivorship and by reason of death not all of the persons can sign, the survivor or survivors;

  * (_f_) a person who has the legal power to sign; or

  * (_g_) to the extent that a person described in any of paragraphs (_a_) to (_f_) may act through an agent or mandatary, the person’s authorized agent or mandatary.

###### Time for determination

(2) The authority of a person signing is determined as of the time of signing.

###### Endorsement

**222.** (1) An endorsement of a security in registered form for the purposes of assignment or transfer is made when an appropriate person signs either the security or a separate document, or when the signature of an appropriate person is written without more on the back of the security.

  * (_a_) in blank; or

  * (_b_) special.

###### Blank endorsement

###### Right of holder

(5) A holder may convert an endorsement in blank into a special endorsement.

###### Immunity of endorser

**223.** Unless agreed otherwise, the endorser does not, by the endorsement, assume any obligation that the security will be honoured by the issuer.

###### Partial endorsement

**224.** An endorsement purporting to be an endorsement of only part of a security representing units intended by the issuer to be separately transferable is effective to the extent of the endorsement.

###### Effect of failure by fiduciary to comply

**225.** Failure of a fiduciary to comply with the instrument or act that is the source of the fiduciary’s power or with the law of the jurisdiction governing the fiduciary relationship does not render the fiduciary’s endorsement unauthorized for the purposes of this Part.

  * 1998, c. 1, s. 225;
  * 2011, c. 21, s. 95(E).

###### Effect of endorsement without delivery

**226.** An endorsement of a security does not constitute a transfer until delivery of the security on which it appears or, if the endorsement is on a separate document, until delivery of both the security and the document.

###### Endorsement in bearer form

**227.** An endorsement of a security in bearer form may give notice of an adverse claim under section 212 but does not otherwise affect any of the holder’s rights.

###### Effect of unauthorized endorsement

**228.** (1) The owner of a security may assert the ineffectiveness of an endorsement against the issuer or a purchaser, other than a good faith purchaser who has in good faith received a new, re-issued or re-registered security on registration of transfer, unless the owner

  * (_a_) has ratified an unauthorized endorsement of the security; or

  * (_b_) is otherwise precluded from impugning the effectiveness of an unauthorized endorsement.

###### Liability of issuer

(2) An issuer who registers the transfer of a security on an unauthorized endorsement is liable for improper registration.

###### Warranties of guarantor of signature

**229.** (1) A person who guarantees the signature of an endorser of a security warrants that, at the time of signing, the signer was an appropriate person to endorse and the signature was genuine.

###### Limitation of liability

(2) A person who guarantees the signature of an endorser does not otherwise warrant the rightfulness of the transfer to which the signature relates.

###### Warranties of guarantor of endorsement

(3) A person who guarantees the endorsement of a security warrants both the signature and the rightfulness, in all respects, of the transfer to which the signature relates, but an issuer may not require a guarantee of endorsement as a condition to registration of transfer.

###### Extent of liability

(4) The guarantees referred to in subsections (1) to (3) are made to any person who, relying on the guarantee, takes or deals with the security, and the guarantor is liable to the person for any loss resulting from breach of warranty.

**230.** Delivery of a security to a purchaser occurs when

  * (_a_) the purchaser or a person designated by the purchaser acquires possession of it;

  * (_b_) the purchaser’s securities broker acquires possession of a security specially endorsed to or issued in the name of the purchaser;

  * (_c_) the purchaser’s securities broker sends the purchaser confirmation of the purchase and the broker in the broker’s records identifies a specific security as belonging to the purchaser; or

(2) If a security is part of a fungible bulk, a purchaser of the security is the owner of the proportionate interest or right in the fungible bulk.

###### Notice to securities broker of adverse claim

(3) Notice of an adverse claim received by a securities broker or by a purchaser after the broker takes delivery as a holder for value is not effective against the broker or the purchaser, except that, as between the broker and the purchaser, the purchaser may demand delivery of an equivalent security in respect of which no notice of an adverse claim has been received.

  * 1998, c. 1, s. 231;
  * 2011, c. 21, s. 96.

###### Delivery of security

**232.** (1) Unless agreed otherwise, if a sale of a security is made on a stock exchange or otherwise through securities brokers,

  * (_b_) the selling securities broker, including a correspondence broker, acting for a selling customer fulfils their duty to deliver by delivering the security or a like security to the buying securities broker or to a person designated by the buying securities broker or by affecting clearance of the sale in accordance with the rules of the exchange on which the transaction took place.

###### Duty to deliver

(2) Except as provided otherwise in this section and unless agreed otherwise, a transferor’s duty to deliver a security under a contract of purchase is not fulfilled until the transferor delivers the security in negotiable form to the purchaser or to a person designated by the purchaser, or causes an acknowledgement to be made to the purchaser that the security is held for the purchaser.

###### Delivery to securities broker

(3) A sale to a securities broker purchasing for the securities broker’s own account is subject to subsection (2) and not subsection (1), unless the sale is made on a stock exchange.

###### Right to reclaim possession

**233.** (1) A person against whom the transfer of a security is wrongful may, against anyone except a good faith purchaser,

  * (_a_) reclaim possession of the security or obtain possession of a new security evidencing all or part of the same rights; or

  * (_b_) claim damages.

###### Recovery when unauthorized endorsement

(2) If the transfer of a security is wrongful by reason of an unauthorized endorsement, the owner may reclaim possession of the security or a new security even from a good faith purchaser if the ineffectiveness of the purported endorsement is asserted against the purchaser under section 228.

###### Right to requisites for registration

**234.** (1) Unless agreed otherwise, a transferor must, on demand, supply a purchaser with proof of the transferor’s authority to transfer a security or with any other requisite that is necessary to obtain registration of the transfer of a security, but if the transfer is not for value, it is not necessary for the transferor to provide authority to transfer unless the purchaser pays the reasonable and necessary costs of the proof and transfer.

###### Rescission of transfer

(2) If a transferor fails to comply with a demand under subsection (1) within a reasonable time, the purchaser may reject or rescind the transfer.

###### Seizure of security

  * 2011, c. 21, s. 97.

###### No liability for acts in good faith

**236.** An agent or mandatary, or a bailee or depositary, who in good faith has received securities and sold, pledged or delivered them according to the instructions of the principal or mandator is not in breach of a fiduciary duty or otherwise liable even though they have no right to dispose of the securities.

###### Assurance of endorsement

**238.** (1) An issuer may require an assurance that each necessary endorsement on a security is genuine and effective by requiring a guarantee of the signature of the person endorsing the security and by requiring

  * (_a_) if the endorsement is by an agent or mandatary, reasonable assurance of authority to sign;

  * (_b_) if the endorsement is by a fiduciary, evidence of appointment or incumbency;

  * (_c_) if there is more than one fiduciary, reasonable assurance that all who are required to sign have done so; and

  * (_d_) in any other case, assurance that corresponds as closely as is feasible to the cases set out in paragraphs (_a_) to (_c_).

###### Sufficiency of guarantee

###### Limited duty of inquiry

**240.** (1) An issuer to whom a security is presented for registration has a duty to inquire into adverse claims if the issuer

  * (_a_) receives written notice of an adverse claim at a time and in a manner that provide the issuer with a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the issue of a new, re-issued or re-registered security and the notice discloses the name and address of the claimant, the registered owner and the issue of which the security is a part; or

  * (_b_) is deemed to have notice of an adverse claim from a document that it obtained under section 239.

###### Discharge of duty

(2) An issuer may discharge a duty of inquiry by any reasonable means, including notifying an adverse claimant by registered mail sent to the address provided by the adverse claimant or, if no such address has been provided, to the adverse claimant’s residence or regular place of business, that a security has been presented for registration of transfer by a named person and that the transfer will be registered unless, no later than thirty days after the date of sending the notice, the issuer

  * (_a_) is served with a restraining order or other order of a court; or

  * (_b_) is provided with an indemnity bond sufficient in the issuer’s judgement to protect the issuer and any transfer agent or other agent or mandatary of the issuer from any loss that may be incurred by any of them as a result of complying with the adverse claim.

###### Inquiry into adverse claim

**241.** (1) Unless an issuer is deemed to have notice of an adverse claim from a document that is obtained under section 239 or has received notice of an adverse claim under subsection 240(1), if a security presented for registration is endorsed by the appropriate person, the issuer has no duty to inquire into adverse claims and, in particular,

  * (_a_) an issuer registering a security in the name of a person who is a fiduciary or who is described as a fiduciary is not bound to inquire into the existence, extent or correct description of the fiduciary relationship and the issuer may then assume without inquiry that the newly registered owner continues to be the fiduciary until the issuer receives written notice that the fiduciary is no longer acting as such with respect to the particular security;

  * (_b_) an issuer registering a transfer on an endorsement by a fiduciary has no duty to inquire into whether the transfer is made in compliance with the document or with the law of the jurisdiction governing the fiduciary relationship; and

  * (_c_) the delivery would result in an overissue to which section 196 applies.

###### Lost or stolen security

**244.** (1) The owner of a security who fails to notify the issuer of an adverse claim, in writing, within a reasonable time after the owner knows of a loss, apparent destruction or wrongful taking of the security is precluded from asserting against the issuer a claim to a new security if the issuer has registered a transfer of the security.

###### Duty to issue new security

(2) If the owner of a security claims that the security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the issuer shall issue a new security in place of the original security if the owner

  * (_a_) so requests before the issuer has notice that the security has been acquired by a good faith purchaser;

  * (_b_) provides the issuer with a sufficient indemnity bond; and

  * (_c_) satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the issuer.

###### Duty to register transfer

(3) If, after the issue of a new security under subsection (2), a good faith purchaser of the original security presents the original security for registration of transfer, the issuer shall register the transfer unless registration would result in an overissue to which section 196 applies.
