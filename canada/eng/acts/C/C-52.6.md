###### Proceedings in respect of memorial

(6) If a memorial is recorded in a province, proceedings may be taken, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the memorial were a document evidencing a judgment or an amount referred to in subsection (4), in the province in respect of the memorial, including proceedings

###### Presentation of documents

(8) If a memorial, or a document relating to it, is presented for recording, for the purpose of any proceeding referred to in subsection (6), to any official in the land, personal property or other registry system of a province, it is to be accepted for recording in the same manner and to the same extent as if the memorial or document were a document evidencing a judgment or an amount referred to in subsection (4) for the purpose of a like proceeding.

###### Access for recording

(9) If access is sought to any person, place or thing in a province for the purpose of recording a memorial, or a document relating to it, the access must be granted in the same manner and to the same extent as if the memorial or document were a document evidencing a judgment or an amount referred to in subsection (4) for the purpose of a like proceeding.

###### Evidence deemed to have been provided

(10) If a memorial or document is issued by the Federal Court or signed or certified by a judge or official of the Court, any affidavit, declaration or other evidence required under the law of the province to be provided with or to accompany the memorial or document in the proceeding is deemed to have been provided with or to have accompanied the memorial or document as so required.

(11) Despite any law of Canada or of a province, no sheriff or other person may, without the written consent of the Minister, sell or otherwise dispose of any property or publish any notice or otherwise advertise in respect of any sale or other disposition of any property pursuant to any process issued or protected interest created in any proceeding to collect an amount certified in a certificate, any interest on the amount and any costs.

###### Completion of notices, etc.

(13) If information required to be set out by any sheriff or other person in a minute, notice or document required to be completed for any purpose cannot, because of subsection (11), be so set out, the sheriff or other person must complete the minute, notice or document to the extent possible without that information and, when the consent of the Minister is given, a further minute, notice or document setting out all the information is to be completed for the same purpose. The sheriff or other person is deemed to have complied with any law or rule of court requiring the information to be set out in the minute, notice or document.

###### Application for an order

(14) A sheriff or other person who is unable, because of subsection (11) or (13), to comply with any law or rule of court is bound by any order made by a judge of the Federal Court, on an ex parte application by the Minister, for the purpose of giving effect to the proceeding or protected interest.

###### Secured claims

(15) A protected interest that is registered in accordance with subsection 87(1) of the [Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act](/canada/eng/acts/B/B-3.md) is deemed to be a claim that

  * (_b_) is referred to in paragraph 86(2)(_a_) of that Act.

###### Details in certificates and memorials

  * (_a_) to set out, as the amount payable by the debtor, the total of amounts payable by the debtor without setting out the separate amounts making up that total; and

  * (_b_) to refer to the rate of interest to be charged on the separate amounts making up the amount payable in general terms as interest at the rate prescribed under this Act applicable from time to time on amounts payable to the Receiver General, without indicating the specific rates of interest to be charged on each of the separate amounts or to be charged for any particular period of time.
