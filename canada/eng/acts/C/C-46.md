###### Principle

(2) It is in the public interest to ensure that public officers may effectively carry out their law enforcement duties in accordance with the rule of law and, to that end, to expressly recognize in law a justification for public officers and other persons acting at their direction to commit acts or omissions that would otherwise constitute offences.

###### Designation of public officers

(3) A competent authority may designate public officers for the purposes of this section and sections 25.2 to 25.4.

###### Condition — civilian oversight

(3.1) A competent authority referred to in paragraph (_a_) or (_b_) of the definition of that term in subsection (1) may not designate any public officer under subsection (3) unless there is a public authority composed of persons who are not peace officers that may review the public officer’s conduct.

###### Declaration as evidence

(3.2) The Governor in Council or the lieutenant governor in council of a province, as the case may be, may designate a person or body as a public authority for the purposes of subsection (3.1), and that designation is conclusive evidence that the person or body is a public authority described in that subsection.

(4) The competent authority shall make designations under subsection (3) on the advice of a senior official and shall consider the nature of the duties performed by the public officer in relation to law enforcement generally, rather than in relation to any particular investigation or enforcement activity.

###### Emergency designation

(6) A senior official may designate a public officer for the purposes of this section and sections 25.2 to 25.4 for a period of not more than 48 hours if the senior official is of the opinion that

The senior official shall without delay notify the competent authority of the designation.

###### Conditions

(7) A designation under subsection (3) or (6) may be made subject to conditions, including conditions limiting

  * (_a_) the duration of the designation;

  * (_b_) the nature of the conduct in the investigation of which a public officer may be justified in committing, or directing another person to commit, acts or omissions that would otherwise constitute an offence; and

###### Justification for acts or omissions

(8) A public officer is justified in committing an act or omission — or in directing the commission of an act or omission under subsection (10) — that would otherwise constitute an offence if the public officer

  * (_b_) is designated under subsection (3) or (6); and

###### Requirements for certain acts

(9) No public officer is justified in committing an act or omission that would otherwise constitute an offence and that would be likely to result in loss of or serious damage to property, or in directing the commission of an act or omission under subsection (10), unless, in addition to meeting the conditions set out in paragraphs (8)(_a_) to (_c_), he or she

  * (_a_) is personally authorized in writing to commit the act or omission — or direct its commission — by a senior official who believes on reasonable grounds that committing the act or omission, as compared to the nature of the offence or criminal activity being investigated, is reasonable and proportional in the circumstances, having regard to such matters as the nature of the act or omission, the nature of the investigation and the reasonable availability of other means for carrying out the public officer’s law enforcement duties; or

  * (_b_) believes on reasonable grounds that the grounds for obtaining an authorization under paragraph (_a_) exist but it is not feasible in the circumstances to obtain the authorization and that the act or omission is necessary to

    * (i) preserve the life or safety of any person,

    * (ii) prevent the compromise of the identity of a public officer acting in an undercover capacity, of a confidential informant or of a person acting covertly under the direction and control of a public officer, or

    * (iii) prevent the imminent loss or destruction of evidence of an indictable offence.

###### Person acting at direction of public officer

(10) A person who commits an act or omission that would otherwise constitute an offence is justified in committing it if

  * (_b_) he or she believes on reasonable grounds that the commission of that act or omission is for the purpose of assisting the public officer in the public officer’s law enforcement duties.

###### Limitation

(11) Nothing in this section justifies

  * (_a_) the intentional or criminally negligent causing of death or bodily harm to another person;

  * (_b_) the wilful attempt in any manner to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice; or

    * (ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s spouse or common-law partner or child,

    * (iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim,

    * (iv) evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal organization, or

    * (v) evidence that the offence was a terrorism offence

shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;

  * (_b_) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;

  * (_c_) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;

  * (_d_) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and

  * (_e_) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.

  * (_a_) any advantage realized by the organization as a result of the offence;

  * (_b_) the degree of planning involved in carrying out the offence and the duration and complexity of the offence;

  * (_c_) whether the organization has attempted to conceal its assets, or convert them, in order to show that it is not able to pay a fine or make restitution;

  * (_d_) the impact that the sentence would have on the economic viability of the organization and the continued employment of its employees;

  * (_e_) the cost to public authorities of the investigation and prosecution of the offence;

  * (_f_) any regulatory penalty imposed on the organization or one of its representatives in respect of the conduct that formed the basis of the offence;

  * (_g_) whether the organization was — or any of its representatives who were involved in the commission of the offence were — convicted of a similar offence or sanctioned by a regulatory body for similar conduct;

###### Application for finding that an offender is a dangerous offender

**753.** (1) The court may, on application made under this Part following the filing of an assessment report under subsection 752.1(2), find the offender to be a dangerous offender if it is satisfied

  * (_a_) that the offence for which the offender has been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph (_a_) of the definition of that expression in section 752 and the offender constitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons on the basis of evidence establishing

    * (i) a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, showing a failure to restrain his or her behaviour and a likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons, or inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons, through failure in the future to restrain his or her behaviour,

    * (ii) a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, showing a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his or her behaviour, or

    * (iii) any behaviour by the offender, associated with the offence for which he or she has been convicted, that is of such a brutal nature as to compel the conclusion that the offender’s behaviour in the future is unlikely to be inhibited by normal standards of behavioural restraint; or

  * (_b_) that the offence for which the offender has been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph (_b_) of the definition of that expression in section 752 and the offender, by his or her conduct in any sexual matter including that involved in the commission of the offence for which he or she has been convicted, has shown a failure to control his or her sexual impulses and a likelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons through failure in the future to control his or her sexual impulses.

###### Time for making application

(2) An application under subsection (1) must be made before sentence is imposed on the offender unless

  * (_b_) at the time of the application under subsection (1) that is not later than six months after the imposition of sentence, it is shown that relevant evidence that was not reasonably available to the prosecution at the time of the imposition of sentence became available in the interim.

###### Application for remand for assessment after imposition of sentence

(3) Notwithstanding subsection 752.1(1), an application under that subsection may be made after the imposition of sentence or after an offender begins to serve the sentence in a case to which paragraphs (2)(_a_) and (_b_) apply.

###### If offender found to be dangerous offender

(4) If the court finds an offender to be a dangerous offender, it shall impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period.

###### If application made after sentencing

(4.1) If the application was made after the offender begins to serve the sentence in a case to which paragraphs (2)(_a_) and (_b_) apply, the sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period referred to in subsection (4) replaces the sentence that was imposed for the offence for which the offender was convicted.

###### If offender not found to be dangerous offender

(5) If the court does not find an offender to be a dangerous offender,

  * (_a_) the court may treat the application as an application to find the offender to be a long-term offender, section 753.1 applies to the application and the court may either find that the offender is a long-term offender or hold another hearing for that purpose; or

  * (_b_) the court may impose sentence for the offence for which the offender has been convicted.

###### Victim evidence

(6) Any evidence given during the hearing of an application made under subsection (1) by a victim of an offence for which the offender was convicted is deemed also to have been given during any hearing under paragraph (5)(_a_) held with respect to the offender.

  * (_c_) there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community.

  * (_b_) the offender

    * (i) has shown a pattern of repetitive behaviour, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, that shows a likelihood of the offender’s causing death or injury to other persons or inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons, or

    * (ii) by conduct in any sexual matter including that involved in the commission of the offence for which the offender has been convicted, has shown a likelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons in the future through similar offences.

###### Exception — if application made after sentencing

(3.1) The court may not impose a sentence under paragraph (3)(_a_) and the sentence that was imposed for the offence for which the offender was convicted stands despite the offender’s being found to be a long-term offender, if the application was one that

  * (_a_) was made after the offender begins to serve the sentence in a case to which paragraphs 753(2)(_a_) and (_b_) apply; and

  * (_b_) was treated as an application under this section further to the court deciding to do so under paragraph 753(5)(_a_).

(4) The court shall not make an order under paragraph (3)(_b_) if the offender has been sentenced to life imprisonment.

###### Exception to length of supervision where new declaration

###### Non-carceral sentences
