  * 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries (or has carried) on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment and with all other persons.

  * 3. In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment including executive and general administrative expenses, whether incurred in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

    * (_b_) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations that differ from those that would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, has not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

  * 4. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

  * 5. Where a company that is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.

  * 6. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing on the earnings of a company attributable to a permanent establishment in that State, or the earnings attributable to the alienation of immovable property situated in that State by a company carrying on a trade in immovable property, a tax in addition to the tax that would be chargeable on the earnings of a company that is a national of that State, except that any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed five per cent of the amount of such earnings that have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years.

However, the term “interest” does not include income dealt with in Article 8 or in Article 10.

  * 4. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

  * 5. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the payer is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

  * 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount that would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.

The term “royalties” also includes payments received as consideration for the furnishing of technical assistance, technical services and consulting services. However, the term “royalties” does not include income dealt with in Article 8.

  * 4. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

  * 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the payer is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

  * 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and another person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount that would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.

    * (_a_) war pensions and allowances (including pensions and allowances paid to war veterans or paid as a consequence of damages or injuries suffered as a consequence of a war) arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in that other State to the extent that they would be exempt from tax if received by a resident of the first-mentioned State; and

    * (_b_) alimony and other similar support payments arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State who is subject to tax therein in respect thereof shall be taxable only in that other State, but the amount taxable in that other State shall not exceed the amount that would be taxable in the first-mentioned State if the recipient were a resident thereof.

### Article 18  
Government Service

  * 1\. (_a_) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration, other than a pension, paid by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State.

  * (_b_) However, such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who:

    * (i) is a national of that State, or

    * (ii) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services.

  * 2. The provisions of Articles 14, 15 and 16 shall apply to salaries, wages and other similar remuneration in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof.

### Article 19  
Students

Payments which a student or business apprentice who is, or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State, a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of that individual’s education or training receives for the purpose of that individual’s maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, if such payments arise from sources outside that State.

### Article 20  
Other Income

  * 1. Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention and arising from sources in the other Contracting State may also be taxed in that other Contracting State.

  * 2. In the case of Canada, where such income is income from a trust, other than a trust to which contributions were deductible, the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the income if the beneficial owner is a resident of Colombia, provided that the income is taxable in Colombia.

## IV. TAXATION OF CAPITAL

### Article 21  
Capital

  * 1. Capital represented by immovable property owned by a resident of a Contracting State and situated in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.

  * 3. Capital represented by ships or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State in international traffic, and by movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that State.

  * 4. All other elements of capital of a resident of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State.

## V. METHODS FOR ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION

### Article 22  
Elimination of Double Taxation

  * 1. In the case of Canada, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:

    * (_a_) subject to the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the deduction from tax payable in Canada of tax paid in a territory outside Canada and to any subsequent modification of those provisions — which shall not affect the general principle hereof — and unless a greater deduction or relief is provided under the laws of Canada, tax payable in Colombia on profits, income or gains arising in Colombia shall be deducted from any Canadian tax payable in respect of such profits, income or gains;

    * (_b_) subject to the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the allowance as a credit against Canadian tax of tax payable in a territory outside Canada and to any subsequent modification of those provisions — which shall not affect the general principle hereof — where a company which is a resident of Colombia pays a dividend to a company which is a resident of Canada and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the first-mentioned company, the credit shall take into account the tax payable in Colombia by that first-mentioned company in respect of the profits out of which such dividend is paid; and

    * (_c_) where, in accordance with any provision of the Convention, income derived by a resident of Canada is exempt from tax in Canada, Canada may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on other income, take into account the exempted income.

  * 2. In the case of Colombia, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:

    * (_a_) Where a resident of a Colombia derives income or owns elements of capital which, under this Convention, may be taxed in the other Contracting State, Colombia shall, subject to the limitations of its domestic laws, allow:

      * (i) as a deduction (descuento) from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the income tax paid in the other State;

      * (ii) as a deduction (descuento) from the tax on the capital of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in the other State on those elements of capital; and

      * (iii) as a deduction (descuento) from the corporate income tax effectively paid by a company that pays out dividends, an amount corresponding to the profits out of which such dividends are paid.

However, such deduction (descuento) shall not exceed that part of the income tax or capital tax calculated before the deduction (descuento) is given, which is attributable to the income or the elements of capital which may be taxed in that other State.

    * (_b_) Where, under any provision of this Convention, income derived or capital owned by a resident of Colombia is exempt from tax in Colombia, Colombia may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of such resident, take into account the exempted income or capital.

  * 3. For the purposes of this Article, profits, income or gains of a resident of a Contracting State that may be taxed in the other Contracting State in accordance with this Convention shall be deemed to arise from sources in that other State.

## VI. SPECIAL PROVISIONS

### Article 23  
Non-Discrimination

  * 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith that is more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.

  * 2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities.

  * 3. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.

  * 4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises which are residents of the first-mentioned State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of a third State, are or may be subjected.

  * 5. In this Article, the term “taxation” means taxes that are the subject of this Convention.

### Article 24  
Mutual Agreement Procedure

  * 1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, address to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which that person is a resident or, alternatively, if that person’s case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 23 to that of the Contracting State of which that person is a national, an application in writing stating the grounds for claiming the revision of such taxation. To be admissible, the said application must be submitted within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.

  * 2. The competent authority referred to in paragraph 1 shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.

  * 3. A Contracting State shall not, after the expiry of the time limits provided in its domestic laws and, in any case, after seven years from the end of the taxable period to which the income concerned was attributed, increase the tax base of a resident of either of the Contracting States by including therein income that has also been included in income in the other Contracting State. This paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud or wilful default.

  * 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention.

  * 5. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention and may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of applying the Convention.

### Article 25  
Exchange of Information

  * 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2.

  * 2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to taxes, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.

  * 3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation

    * (_a_) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and the administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;

    * (_b_) to supply information that is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; or

    * (_c_) to supply information that would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (_ordre public_).

  * 4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though the other State does not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.

  * 5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or fiduciary capacity or because the information relates to ownership interests in a person.

### Article 26  
Anti-Abuse Clauses

  * 1. The provisions of Articles 10, 11 and 12 shall not apply if the purpose or one of the main purposes of any person in relation to the creation or assignment of a share, a debt-claim, or a right with respect to which dividends, interest or royalties are paid, was to derive benefits from one or more of those Articles through such creation or assignment.

  * 2. Nothing in the Convention shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing a tax on amounts included in the income of a resident of that State with respect to a partnership, trust, company, or other entity in which that resident has an interest.

  * 3. The Convention shall not apply to any company, trust or other entity that is a resident of a Contracting State and is beneficially owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more persons who are not residents of that State, if the amount of the tax imposed on the income or capital of the company, trust, partnership or other entity by that State is substantially lower than the amount that would be imposed by that State (after taking into account any reduction or offset of the amount of tax in any manner, including a refund, reimbursement, contribution, credit, or allowance to the company, trust or partnership, or to any other person) if all of the shares of the capital stock of the company or all of the interests in the trust or other entity, as the case may be, were beneficially owned by one or more individuals who were residents of that State.

  * 4. In the event that one or more of the provisions of the Convention give rise to results that were not intended or envisaged thereunder, the Contracting States shall consult each other on the matter with a view towards reaching a mutually acceptable solution, including possible amendments to the Convention.

### Article 27  
Members of Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts

  * 1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.

  * 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 4, an individual who is a member of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a Contracting State that is situated in the other Contracting State or in a third State shall be deemed for the purposes of the Convention to be a resident only of the sending State if that individual is liable in the sending State to the same obligations in relation to tax on total income as are residents of that sending State.

### Article 28  
Miscellaneous Rules

  * 1. The provisions of this Convention shall not be construed to restrict in any manner any exemption, allowance, credit or other deduction accorded by the laws of a Contracting State in the determination of the tax imposed by that State.

  * 2. For the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article XXII (Consultation) of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the Contracting States agree that, notwithstanding that paragraph, any dispute between them as to whether a measure falls within the scope of the Convention may be brought before the Council for Trade in Services, as provided by that paragraph, only with the consent of both Contracting States. Any doubt as to the interpretation of this paragraph shall be resolved under paragraph 4 of Article 24 or, failing agreement under that procedure, pursuant to any other procedure agreed to by both Contracting States.

  * 3. Contributions in a year in respect of services rendered in that year paid by, or on behalf of, an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State or who is temporarily present in that State to a pension plan that is recognized for tax purposes in the other Contracting State shall, during a period not exceeding in the aggregate 60 months, be treated in the same way for tax purposes in the first-mentioned State as a contribution paid to a pension plan that is recognized for tax purposes in that first-mentioned State, if

    * (_a_) such individual was contributing on a regular basis to the pension plan for a period ending immediately before that individual became a resident of or temporarily present in the first-mentioned State; and

    * (_b_) the competent authority of the first-mentioned State agrees that the pension plan generally corresponds to a pension plan recognized for tax purposes by that State.

For the purposes of this paragraph, “pension plan” includes a pension plan created under the social security system in a Contracting State.

## VII. FINAL PROVISIONS

### Article 29  
Entry into Force

  * 1. Each of the Contracting States shall notify the other through diplomatic channels of the completion of the procedures required by law for the bringing into force of the Convention. The Convention shall enter into force on the date of the later of these notifications and its provisions shall thereupon have effect:

## SCHEDULE 2 - (Section 2) - PROTOCOL

At the time of signing of this Convention between Canada and the Republic of Colombia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital, the undersigned have agreed upon the following provisions which shall be an integral part of the Convention.

  * 1. It is understood that

    * (_a_) With reference to paragraph 3 of Article 5, for the purpose of calculating the time limit referred to therein, the period during which the activities carried out by an enterprise associated with another enterprise within the meaning of Article 9 shall be added to the period during which the activities are carried out by the enterprise with which it is associated, provided that the activities of the two enterprises are identical or substantially similar and are carried on in connection with the same site or project.

    * (_b_) With reference to paragraph 3 of Article 5, planning, preparatory work and supervisory activities shall be considered to be associated to a building site or construction or installation project only where such work or activities are performed at the location of the building site or construction or installation project.

    * (_c_) For purposes of Article 7, profits are attributed to a permanent establishment under paragraph 2 of Article 7 as if the permanent establishment were a separate enterprise dealing independently from the enterprise of which it is a part. Paragraph 3 of Article 7 sets out the principle that expenses incurred by the enterprise for the purpose of the permanent establishment, wherever incurred, shall be allowed as a deduction in attributing profits to the permanent establishment. In applying that paragraph, deductibility of expenses shall be determined in accordance with the internal legislation of the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is located, provided that the requirements, conditions, and limitations to which they are subjected, are complied with.

    * (_d_) In the case of Colombia, for the purposes of this Convention, the term “ships” includes vessels.

    * (_e_) In the case of Colombia, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 10, when a company resident in Colombia has not paid income tax on the profit distributed to shareholders (socios o accionistas), because of exemptions or because the profit exceeds the maximum non-taxed limit contained in Article 49 and in paragraph 1 of Article 245 of the Tax Statute, the dividend distributed may be taxed in Colombia at a rate of 15 per cent, if the beneficial owner of the dividend is a shareholder (socio o accionista) resident in Canada.

    * (_f_) For greater certainty, the term “right” in paragraph 4 of Article 12 includes contractual rights to receive payments in respect of the furnishing of technical assistance, technical services or consulting services.

    * (_g_) If, after the signing of the Convention, Colombia concludes with a third state a Convention which provides for provisions in respect of technical assistance, technical services or consulting services that are more favourable than those provided for in Article 12 of the Convention, such provisions shall apply automatically to the Convention, under the same conditions as if such provisions had been set out in the Convention. Such provisions shall apply to this Convention from the date of entry into force of the convention with the third state. The competent authority of Colombia shall inform the competent authority of Canada without delay that the conditions of application of this subparagraph have been fulfilled.

    * (_h_) Paragraphs 6 and 7 of Article 13 are included in the Convention in view of Canada’s domestic rules regarding taxpayer migration. At the time of the signature of the Convention, Colombia has no similar domestic rules and, therefore, it is anticipated that these paragraphs will initially only apply in the case of an individual who ceases to be a resident of Canada.

    * (_i_) With reference to paragraph 2 of Article 20, it is agreed to have that paragraph apply only in the case of Canada on the understanding that under the domestic law of Colombia, income from a trust retains the legal characterization of the underlying income earned by that trust.

    * (_j_) For greater certainty, the seven year time limit referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 24 and paragraph 3 of Article 9 shall only apply if the domestic law of the Contracting State first-mentioned in such paragraphs provides for a longer time period.

IN WITNESS whereof the undersigned, duly authorised thereto, by their respective Governments, have signed this Protocol.
