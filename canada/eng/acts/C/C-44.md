###### Transmission of securities

(7) Subject to any applicable law relating to the collection of taxes, a person referred to in paragraph (2)(_a_) is entitled to become a registered holder, or to designate a registered holder, if the person deposits with the corporation or its transfer agent

    * (i) the court that granted the probate or letters of administration, or the notary who prepared the minutes of the probate,

    * (ii) a trust company incorporated under the laws of Canada or a province, or

    * (iii) a lawyer or notary acting on behalf of the person referred to in paragraph (2)(_a_), or

  * (_b_) in the case of transmission by notarial will in Quebec, an authentic copy established in accordance with the laws of that province,

together with

  * (_c_) an affidavit or declaration of transmission made by a person referred to in paragraph (2)(_a_), stating the particulars of the transmission, and

###### Excepted transmissions

(8) Despite subsection (7), if the laws of the jurisdiction governing the transmission of a security of a deceased holder do not require a grant of probate or of letters of administration or the probate of the will or the notarial minutes of the probate in respect of the transmission, a personal representative of the deceased holder is entitled, subject to any applicable law relating to the collection of taxes, to become a registered holder or to designate a registered holder, if the personal representative deposits with the corporation or its transfer agent

  * (_a_) the security certificate that was owned by the deceased holder; and

  * 2001, c. 14, ss. 31, 135(E);
  * 2011, c. 21, s. 31.

###### Overissue

**52.** (1) The provisions of this Part that validate a security or compel its issue or reissue do not apply to the extent that validation, issue or reissue would result in overissue, but

  * (_a_) if a valid security, similar in all respects to the security involved in the overissue, is reasonably available for purchase, the person entitled to the validation or issue may compel the issuer to purchase and deliver such a security against surrender of the security that the person holds;

  * (_b_) if a valid security, similar in all respects to the security involved in the overissue, is not reasonably available for purchase, the person entitled to the validation or issue may recover from the issuer an amount equal to the price the last purchaser for value paid for the invalid security.

###### Retroactive validation

(2) When an issuer amends its articles or a trust indenture to which it is a party to increase its authorized securities to a number equal to or in excess of the number of securities previously authorized plus the amount of the securities overissued, the securities so overissued are valid from the date of their issue.

###### Payment not a purchase or redemption

(3) A purchase or payment by an issuer under subsection (1) is not a purchase or payment to which section 34, 35, 36 or 39 applies.

  * R.S., 1985, c. C-44, s. 52;
  * 2001, c. 14, s. 135(E).

**53.** In an action on a security,

  * (_a_) unless specifically denied in the pleadings, each signature on the security or in a necessary endorsement is admitted;

  * (_b_) a signature on the security is presumed to be genuine and authorized but, if the effectiveness of the signature is put in issue, the burden of establishing that it is genuine and authorized is on the party claiming under the signature;

  * (_c_) if a signature is admitted or established, production of the instrument entitles a holder to recover on it unless the defendant establishes a defence or a defect going to the validity of the security; and

  * (_d_) if the defendant establishes that a defence or defect exists, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the defence or defect is ineffective against the plaintiff or some person under whom the plaintiff claims.

  * R.S., 1985, c. C-44, s. 53;
  * 2001, c. 14, s. 135(E).

  * 2001, c. 14, s. 135(E).

## Issue — Issuer

###### Notice of defect

**55.** (1) Even against a purchaser for value without notice of a defect going to the validity of a security, the terms of the security include those stated on the security and those incorporated in it by reference to another instrument or act, statute, rule, regulation or order to the extent that the terms so incorporated do not conflict with the stated terms, but such a reference is not of itself notice to a purchaser for value of a defect going to the validity of the security, even though the security expressly states that a person accepting it admits the notice.

###### Purchaser for value

(2) A security is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value without notice of any defect going to its validity.

###### Lack of genuineness

(3) Subject to section 57, the fact that a security is not genuine is a complete defence even against a purchaser for value without notice.

###### Ineffective defences

(4) All other defences of an issuer, including non-delivery and conditional delivery of a security, are ineffective against a purchaser for value without notice of the particular defence.

  * R.S., 1985, c. C-44, s. 55;
  * 2011, c. 21, s. 32(E).

###### Staleness as notice of defect

**56.** After an event that creates a right to immediate performance of the principal obligation evidenced by a security, or that sets a date on or after which a security is to be presented or surrendered for redemption or exchange, a purchaser is deemed to have notice of any defect in its issue or of any defence of the issuer,

  * (_a_) if the event requires the payment of money or the delivery of securities, or both, on presentation or surrender of the security, and such money or securities are available on the date set for payment or exchange, and the purchaser takes the security more than one year after that date; or

  * (_b_) if the purchaser takes the security more than two years after the date set for presentation or surrender or the date on which such performance became due.

  * R.S., 1985, c. C-44, s. 56;
  * 2001, c. 14, s. 135(E).

###### Unauthorized signature

**57.** An unauthorized signature on a security before or in the course of its issue is ineffective, except that the signature is effective in favour of a purchaser for value and without notice of the lack of authority, if the signing has been done by

  * (_a_) an authenticating trustee, registrar, transfer agent or other person entrusted by the issuer with the signing of the security, or of similar securities, or their immediate preparation for signing; or

  * (_b_) an employee of the issuer or of a person referred to in paragraph (_a_) who in the ordinary course of their duties handles the security.

  * (_a_) any person may complete it by filling in the blanks in accordance with their authority; and

  * (_b_) notwithstanding that the blanks are incorrectly filled in, the security as completed is enforceable by a purchaser who took it for value and without notice of such incorrectness.

###### Enforceability

(2) A completed security that has been improperly altered, even if fraudulently altered, remains enforceable but only according to its original terms.

  * R.S., 1985, c. C-44, s. 58;
  * 2001, c. 14, s. 135(E).

###### Warranties of agents

**59.** (1) A person signing a security as authenticating trustee, registrar, transfer agent or other person entrusted by the issuer with the signing of the security warrants to a purchaser for value without notice that

  * (_a_) the security is genuine;

  * (_b_) the person’s acts in connection with the issue of the security are within their authority; and

  * (_c_) the person has reasonable grounds for believing that the security is in the form and within the amount the issuer is authorized to issue.

###### Limitation of liability

(2) Unless otherwise agreed, a person referred to in subsection (1) does not assume any further liability for the validity of a security.

  * R.S., 1985, c. C-44, s. 59;
  * 2001, c. 14, s. 135(E).

## Purchase

###### Title of purchaser

**60.** (1) On delivery of a security the purchaser acquires the rights in the security that the transferor had or had authority to convey, except that a purchaser who has been a party to any fraud or illegality affecting the security or who as a prior holder had notice of an adverse claim does not improve their position by taking from a later bona fide purchaser.

###### Title of bona fide purchaser

(2) A bona fide purchaser, in addition to acquiring the rights of a purchaser, also acquires the security free from any adverse claim.

###### Limitation of the purchase

(3) A purchaser acquires rights only to the extent of the interest or right purchased.

###### Deemed notice of adverse claim

**61.** (1) A purchaser of a security, or any broker for a seller or purchaser, is deemed to have notice of an adverse claim if

  * (_a_) the security, whether in bearer or registered form, has been endorsed “for collection” or “for surrender” or for some other purpose not involving transfer; or

  * (_b_) the security is in bearer form and has on it a statement that it is the property of a person other than the transferor, except that the mere writing of a name on a security is not such a statement.

###### Notice of fiduciary duty

(2) Notwithstanding that a purchaser, or any broker for a seller or purchaser, has notice that a security is held for a third person or is registered in the name of or endorsed by a fiduciary, they have no duty to inquire into the rightfulness of the transfer and have no notice of an adverse claim, except that where they know that the consideration is to be used for, or that the transaction is for, the personal benefit of the fiduciary or is otherwise in breach of the fiduciary’s duty, the purchaser or broker is deemed to have notice of an adverse claim.

  * R.S., 1985, c. C-44, s. 61;
  * 2001, c. 14, s. 135(E).

###### Staleness as notice of adverse claim

**62.** An event that creates a right to immediate performance of the principal obligation evidenced by a security or that sets a date on or after which the security is to be presented or surrendered for redemption or exchange is not of itself notice of an adverse claim, except in the case of a purchase

  * (_a_) after one year from any date set for such presentation or surrender for redemption or exchange; or

  * (_b_) after six months from any date set for payment of money against presentation or surrender of the security if funds are available for payment on that date.

###### Warranties to purchaser

(2) A person by transferring a security to a purchaser for value warrants only that

  * (_a_) the transfer is effective and rightful;

  * (_b_) the security is genuine and has not been materially altered; and

###### Warranties of intermediary

(3) Where a security is delivered by an intermediary known by the purchaser to be entrusted with delivery of the security on behalf of another or with collection of a draft or other claim to be collected against such delivery, the intermediary by such delivery warrants only the intermediary’s good faith and authority even if the intermediary has purchased or made advances against the draft or other claim to be collected against the delivery.

###### Warranties of pledgee

(4) A pledgee or other holder for purposes of security who redelivers a security received, or after payment and on order of the debtor delivers that security to a third person, gives only the warranties of an intermediary under subsection (3).

###### Warranties of broker

(5) A broker gives to a customer, to the issuer or to a purchaser, as the case may be, the warranties provided in this section and has the rights and privileges of a purchaser under this section, and those warranties of and in favour of the broker acting as an agent or mandatary are in addition to warranties given by the customer and warranties given in favour of the customer.

  * 2001, c. 14, s. 135(E);
  * 2011, c. 21, s. 34(E).

###### Right to compel endorsement

**64.** When a security in registered form is delivered to a purchaser without a necessary endorsement, the purchaser may become a bona fide purchaser only as of the time the endorsement is supplied, but against the transferor the transfer is complete on delivery and the purchaser has a specifically enforceable right to have any necessary endorsement supplied.

###### Failure of fiduciary to comply
