  * (_b_) the requested form is otherwise on public grounds objectionable.

###### Effect of order

###### Books for entry of particulars of registrations and transfers

(2) Unless the books for the registration and transfer of the shares of the capital stock and of the bonds, debentures, debenture stock and other securities of the company are kept at the chief place of business or head office of the company in Canada, a book or books shall be kept at such chief place of business or head office or at the place in Canada where one of its branch registration and transfer offices is maintained, in which shall be recorded particulars of every registration and transfer of shares of its capital stock and of the bonds, debentures, debenture stock and other securities issued by the company; but entry of the transfer of any share, bond, debenture, debenture stock or other security in a register of transfers or a branch register of transfers, whether kept at the chief place of business or head office of the company or elsewhere, is, for all purposes, a complete and valid transfer.

###### Part I companies

(3) In the case of a company to which Part I applies, subsection (2) does not apply to the register of transfers, branch registers of transfers and books mentioned in section 110.

###### Rectification of books

(4) The court, as defined in subsection 3(1), of the province in which the head office or chief place of business of the company is situated, has jurisdiction, on the application of any person interested, to order that any entry in the books for the registration and transfer of shares of the capital stock of a company be struck out or otherwise rectified on the ground that at the date of such application the entry as it appears in any such book does not accurately express or define the existing rights of the person appearing to be the registered owner of any shares of the capital stock of the company; and the court, in deciding such application, may make such order as to costs as the court may deem proper.

###### Application for rectification

(5) An application for the rectification of any such entry under subsection (4) may be made either by filing with the proper officer of the court a petition or an originating summons or notice of motion; and the court may direct the trial of any issue arising out of such application.

###### Saving of jurisdiction

###### Power of court to grant relief in certain cases

(2) Where in any proceeding for breach of or non-compliance with this Act or breach of or non-compliance with the letters patent, supplementary letters patent, Special Act, or by-laws of a company or corporation, against a person to whom this section applies, it appears to the court hearing the case that that person is or may be liable in respect of such breach or non-compliance, but that he has acted honestly and reasonably, and that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including those connected with his appointment, he ought fairly to be excused for such breach or non-compliance, that court may relieve him, either wholly or partly, from his liability on such terms as the court may think fit.

###### Application for relief

(3) Where any person to whom this section applies has reason to apprehend that any claim will or might be made against him in respect of any such breach or non-compliance, he may apply to the court, as defined in subsection 3(1), of the province in which the head office or the principal place of business of the company or corporation is situated, for relief, and the court on such application has the same power to relieve him as under this section it would have had if it had been a court before which proceedings against that person for such breach or non-compliance had been brought.

###### Case may be withdrawn from jury

(4) Where any case to which subsection (2) applies is being tried by a judge with a jury, the judge, after hearing the evidence, may, if he is satisfied that the defendant ought in pursuance of that subsection to be relieved either in whole or in part from the liability sought to be enforced against him, withdraw the case in whole or in part from the jury and forthwith direct judgment to be entered for the defendant on such terms as to costs or otherwise as the judge may think proper.

  * R.S., 1952, c. 53, s. 211.
