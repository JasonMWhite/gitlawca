  * (_b_) two shareholders that are corporations and at least one of which is not a member of the constrained-class shall not be deemed to be associated with each other by virtue of paragraph (3)(_f_) by reason only that each shareholder is deemed under paragraph (3)(_a_) to be associated with the same shareholder; and

  * (_b_) if, when the total number of voting shares of the company held by or for members of the constrained-class is equal to or less than the gross prescribed percentage for the company, the transfer would cause the total number of such shares held by or for members of the constrained-class to exceed the gross prescribed percentage;

  * (_c_) if, when the total number of voting shares of the company held by or for a member of the constrained-class exceeds the net prescribed percentage for the company, the transfer would increase the percentage of such shares held by or for such member; or

###### Transfer by nominees

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the directors of a constrained-share company may allow a transfer of any voting share of the company to be made or recorded in the register of the company where the transfer is to a member of the constrained-class, if it is shown to the directors on evidence satisfactory to them that the share was on the prescribed day held in the right of or for the use or benefit of the transferee.

###### Subscription for shares

**3.** (1) The directors of a constrained-share company shall not accept a subscription for a voting share of the company,

  * (_b_) except as otherwise provided in subsection (2), in other circumstances where if the subscription were a transfer of the voting share the directors would be required under section 2 of these provisions to refuse to allow the transfer to be made or recorded; but in the case of a subscription pursuant to an offer of original unsubscribed capital stock, or of any increased capital stock of the company, to the shareholders of the company, the directors may count as shares issued and outstanding all the voting shares included in the offer to its shareholders.

###### Exception

(2) Subject to paragraph (1)(_a_), where an offer of voting shares of the original unsubscribed capital stock, or of any increased capital stock, of a constrained-share company is made to its shareholders, the directors may accept any subscription

  * (_a_) if the terms of the offer contain provisions to the effect that in the case of a voting share offered to a shareholder who, at the time fixed for determining the shareholders to whom the offer is made, is not, to the knowledge of the directors, a member of the constrained-class, a subscription will not be accepted if the voting share is to be recorded in the name of a member of the constrained-class;

  * (_b_) if the subscription is accompanied by a declaration by the subscriber stating that the person in whose name the voting share is to be recorded is not a member of the constrained-class; and

###### Voting rights restricted

**5.** (1) Except as otherwise provided by section 7 of these provisions, where a person who is not a member of the constrained-class holds shares of a constrained-share company in the right of or for the use or benefit of a member of the constrained-class, such person shall not, in person or by proxy, exercise the voting rights pertaining to these shares.

###### Idem

(2) Except as otherwise provided by section 7 of these provisions, if the proportion of the shares of a constrained-share company held by or for a member of the constrained-class exceeds the net prescribed percentage for the company, no person shall, in person or by proxy, exercise the voting rights pertaining to any shares held in the name of the member of the constrained-class.

###### Exception

(3) Where it appears from the register of the company that the total par value of shares, or the total number of shares, of the company held by a shareholder is not more than the value or number specified for the purpose in the letters patent or supplementary letters patent by which the company became a constrained-share company, a person acting as proxy for the shareholder at a general meeting of the company is entitled to assume that the shareholder holds the shares in his own right and for his own use and benefit, unless the knowledge of the person acting as proxy is to the contrary.

###### Effect of contravention

(5) If a provision of this section is contravened at a general meeting of the shareholders of a company, no proceeding, matter or thing at that meeting is void by reason only of such contravention, but any such proceeding, matter or thing is, at any time within twelve months from the day of commencement of the general meeting at which the contravention occurred, voidable at the option of the directors of the company by a by-law duly passed by the directors and sanctioned by two-thirds of the votes cast at a special general meeting of the shareholders called for the purpose.

###### By-laws

**6.** (1) The directors of a constrained-share company may make such by-laws as they deem necessary to carry out the intent of these provisions and in particular, but without restricting the generality of the foregoing, the directors may make by-laws

  * (_a_) requiring any person in whose name a share of the company is held to submit a declaration

    * (i) with respect to his direct or indirect ownership of any shares of the company,

    * (ii) whether the shareholder and any person in whose right or for whose use or benefit the share is held are residents,

###### Reliance upon information

(3) In determining for the purposes of these statutory provisions whether a person is or is not a resident or a Canadian, whether an individual is a Canadian citizen, whether a corporation is directly or indirectly controlled by persons who are not residents or any other circumstances relevant to the performance of the duties of the directors under these provisions, the company and any director, officer, employee or agent of the company may rely upon any statements made in any declaration submitted under these provisions or rely upon the knowledge of any of the directors of such circumstances; and the company, directors, officers, employees or agents are not liable in any action for anything done or omitted by them in good faith as a result of any conclusions made by them on the basis of any such statements or knowledge.

###### Computing non-resident holdings

(4) Where, for any of the purposes of these provisions, the directors require to establish the total number of voting shares of the company held by non-residents, the directors may calculate the total number of such shares held by non-residents to be the total of

  * (_a_) the number of voting shares held by all shareholders whose recorded addresses are places outside Canada; and

  * (_b_) the number of voting shares held by all shareholders whose recorded addresses are places within Canada but who, to the knowledge of the directors, are non-residents;

and such calculation may be made as of a date not earlier than the prescribed day or four months before the day on which the calculation is made, whichever is the later date.

###### Limiting transfers to non-residents

(5) Where by any calculation made under subsection (4) the total number of voting shares held by non-residents is equal to or less than the gross prescribed percentage for the company, the number of voting shares, the transfer of which by residents to non-residents the directors may allow to be made or recorded in the register of the company, shall be so limited as not to increase the total number of voting shares held by non-residents to more than the gross prescribed percentage.

###### Exception for small holdings

(6) Notwithstanding section 2 of these provisions, where in the case of a transfer of any shares of the company to a transferee it appears that

  * (_a_) the total par value of voting shares, or the total number of voting shares, of the company held by the transferee as shown by the register of the company at a date not more than four months earlier is not more than the value or number specified for the purpose in the letters patent or supplementary letters patent by which the company became a constrained-share company, and

  * (_b_) the total par value of voting shares, or total number of voting shares, of the company included in the transfer and any voting shares acquired by the transferee after the date mentioned in paragraph (_a_) and still held by him as shown by the register of the company is not more than the value or number specified for the purpose in the letters patent or supplementary letters patent by which the company became a constrained-share company,

the directors are entitled to assume that the transferee is not and will not be associated with any member of the constrained-class and, unless the knowledge of the directors is to the contrary, that he is not a member of the constrained-class.

###### Constrained ownership of shares

**7.** (1) Notwithstanding section 2 or 3 of these provisions, where it is necessary for a constrained-share company to reduce the total percentage of its voting shares or of any class of its voting shares, held by or for members of the constrained-class after the prescribed day for either of the purposes described in subsection 41.1(2), if at the commencement of the prescribed day the number of voting shares of the constrained-share company held by or for members of the constrained-class exceeded the gross prescribed percentage for the company, the directors, so long as the total number of voting shares held by or for all members of the constrained-class exceeds the gross prescribed percentage,

  * (_a_) shall refuse to allow a transfer of a voting share of the company to a member of the constrained-class to be made or recorded in the register of the company; and

  * (_b_) shall not accept a subscription for a voting share of the company by a member of the constrained-class.

###### Exception for individual holdings

(2) Where at the commencement of the prescribed day the number of voting shares of the company held by or for a member of the constrained-class exceeded the net prescribed percentage for the company, the voting rights pertaining to the shares held by or for that member may, notwithstanding section 5 of these provisions, be exercised, in person or by proxy, so long as the percentage of such shares held by or for such member does not exceed either the percentage of such shares held by or for him at the commencement of the prescribed day or the smallest percentage of such shares held by or for him on any subsequent day; but this subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the exercise of voting rights in circumstances where section 5 of these provisions does not apply.
