###### Exception

(2) A compromise or arrangement in respect of a debtor company may not deal with any claim that relates to any of the following debts or liabilities unless the compromise or arrangement explicitly provides for the claim’s compromise and the creditor in relation to that debt has voted for the acceptance of the compromise or arrangement:

###### Determination of amount of claims

**20.** (1) For the purposes of this Act, the amount represented by a claim of any secured or unsecured creditor is to be determined as follows:

    * (i) in the case of a company in the course of being wound up under the [Winding-up and Restructuring Act](/canada/eng/acts/W/W-11.md), proof of which has been made in accordance with that Act,

    * (ii) in the case of a company that has made an authorized assignment or against which a bankruptcy order has been made under the [Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act](/canada/eng/acts/B/B-3.md), proof of which has been made in accordance with that Act, or

    * (iii) in the case of any other company, proof of which might be made under the [Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act](/canada/eng/acts/B/B-3.md), but if the amount so provable is not admitted by the company, the amount is to be determined by the court on summary application by the company or by the creditor; and

  * (_b_) the amount of a secured claim is the amount, proof of which might be made under the [Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act](/canada/eng/acts/B/B-3.md) if the claim were unsecured, but the amount if not admitted by the company is, in the case of a company subject to pending proceedings under the [Winding-up and Restructuring Act](/canada/eng/acts/W/W-11.md) or the [Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act](/canada/eng/acts/B/B-3.md), to be established by proof in the same manner as an unsecured claim under the [Winding-up and Restructuring Act](/canada/eng/acts/W/W-11.md) or the [Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act](/canada/eng/acts/B/B-3.md), as the case may be, and, in the case of any other company, the amount is to be determined by the court on summary application by the company or the creditor.

###### Admission of claims

(2) Despite subsection (1), the company may admit the amount of a claim for voting purposes under reserve of the right to contest liability on the claim for other purposes, and nothing in this Act, the [Winding-up and Restructuring Act](/canada/eng/acts/W/W-11.md) or the [Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act](/canada/eng/acts/B/B-3.md) prevents a secured creditor from voting at a meeting of secured creditors or any class of them in respect of the total amount of a claim as admitted.

(2) Within 15 days after the day on which the company gives notice under subsection (1), a party to the agreement may, on notice to the other parties to the agreement and the monitor, apply to a court for an order that the agreement is not to be disclaimed or resiliated.

###### Court-ordered disclaimer or resiliation

(3) If the monitor does not approve the proposed disclaimer or resiliation, the company may, on notice to the other parties to the agreement and the monitor, apply to a court for an order that the agreement be disclaimed or resiliated.

###### Factors to be considered

(4) In deciding whether to make the order, the court is to consider, among other things,

  * (_a_) whether the monitor approved the proposed disclaimer or resiliation;

  * (_b_) whether the disclaimer or resiliation would enhance the prospects of a viable compromise or arrangement being made in respect of the company; and

  * (_c_) whether the disclaimer or resiliation would likely cause significant financial hardship to a party to the agreement.

###### Date of disclaimer or resiliation

(5) An agreement is disclaimed or resiliated

  * (_a_) if no application is made under subsection (2), on the day that is 30 days after the day on which the company gives notice under subsection (1);

  * (_c_) if the court orders that the agreement is disclaimed or resiliated under subsection (3), on the day that is 30 days after the day on which the company gives notice or on any later day fixed by the court.

###### Intellectual property

(6) If the company has granted a right to use intellectual property to a party to an agreement, the disclaimer or resiliation does not affect the party’s right to use the intellectual property — including the party’s right to enforce an exclusive use — during the term of the agreement, including any period for which the party extends the agreement as of right, as long as the party continues to perform its obligations under the agreement in relation to the use of the intellectual property.

###### Loss related to disclaimer or resiliation

(7) If an agreement is disclaimed or resiliated, a party to the agreement who suffers a loss in relation to the disclaimer or resiliation is considered to have a provable claim.

###### Collective agreements

**33.** (1) If proceedings under this Act have been commenced in respect of a debtor company, any collective agreement that the company has entered into as the employer remains in force, and may not be altered except as provided in this section or under the laws of the jurisdiction governing collective bargaining between the company and the bargaining agent.

###### Application for authorization to serve notice to bargain

(2) A debtor company that is a party to a collective agreement and that is unable to reach a voluntary agreement with the bargaining agent to revise any of the provisions of the collective agreement may, on giving five days notice to the bargaining agent, apply to the court for an order authorizing the company to serve a notice to bargain under the laws of the jurisdiction governing collective bargaining between the company and the bargaining agent.

###### Conditions for issuance of order

(3) The court may issue the order only if it is satisfied that

  * (_a_) a viable compromise or arrangement could not be made in respect of the company, taking into account the terms of the collective agreement;

  * (_b_) the company has made good faith efforts to renegotiate the provisions of the collective agreement; and

  * (_c_) a failure to issue the order is likely to result in irreparable damage to the company.

###### No delay on vote

(4) The vote of the creditors in respect of a compromise or an arrangement may not be delayed solely because the period provided in the laws of the jurisdiction governing collective bargaining between the company and the bargaining agent has not expired.

###### Claims arising from termination or amendment

(5) If the parties to the collective agreement agree to revise the collective agreement after proceedings have been commenced under this Act in respect of the company, the bargaining agent that is a party to the agreement is deemed to have a claim, as an unsecured creditor, for an amount equal to the value of concessions granted by the bargaining agent with respect to the remaining term of the collective agreement.

###### Order to disclose information

(6) On the application of the bargaining agent and on notice to the person to whom the application relates, the court may, subject to any terms and conditions it specifies, make an order requiring the person to make available to the bargaining agent any information specified by the court in the person’s possession or control that relates to the company’s business or financial affairs and that is relevant to the collective bargaining between the company and the bargaining agent. The court may make the order only after the company has been authorized to serve a notice to bargain under subsection (2).

###### Parties

(7) For the purpose of this section, the parties to a collective agreement are the debtor company and the bargaining agent that are bound by the collective agreement.

###### Unrevised collective agreements remain in force

(8) For greater certainty, any collective agreement that the company and the bargaining agent have not agreed to revise remains in force, and the court shall not alter its terms.

  * 2005, c. 47, s. 131.

###### Certain rights limited

**34.** (1) No person may terminate or amend, or claim an accelerated payment or forfeiture of the term under, any agreement, including a security agreement, with a debtor company by reason only that proceedings commenced under this Act or that the company is insolvent.

###### Lease

(2) If the agreement referred to in subsection (1) is a lease, the lessor may not terminate or amend the lease by reason only that proceedings commenced under this Act, that the company is insolvent or that the company has not paid rent in respect of any period before the commencement of those proceedings.

###### Public utilities

(3) No public utility may discontinue service to a company by reason only that proceedings commenced under this Act, that the company is insolvent or that the company has not paid for services rendered or goods provided before the commencement of those proceedings.
