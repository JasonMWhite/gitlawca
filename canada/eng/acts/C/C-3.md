###### Discharge of liability

(3) Payment under this section by the Corporation in respect of any deposit insured by deposit insurance discharges the Corporation from all liability to the extent of the amount of the payment made in respect of that deposit, and in no case is the Corporation under any obligation to see to the proper application in any way of the payment so made.

###### Subrogation

(4) Where the Corporation makes a payment under this section in respect of any deposit with a member institution, the Corporation is subrogated, to the extent of the amount of the payment made, to all the rights and interests of the depositor and may maintain an action in respect of those rights and interests in the name of the depositor or in the name of the Corporation.

###### Priority

(4.1) Where the Corporation makes a payment under this section in respect of any deposit with a member institution that is being wound up, the Corporation ranks,
