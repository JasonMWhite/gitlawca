The application must be in a form that is acceptable to the Corporation and must contain the information that the Corporation may require.

  * 1997, c. 15, s. 114;
  * 2007, c. 6, s. 410.

###### Granting of application

  * (_a_) [Repealed, 2001, c. 9, s. 209]

  * (_b_) the sum of all the deposits held by the federal member institution that are less than $150,000 and payable in Canada is less than one per cent of the sum of all the deposits held by the institution that are payable in Canada;

    * (i) that the institution has applied to become authorized to accept deposits while no longer being a member institution,

  * (_b_) an order made under paragraph (1)(_b_) prevents any person, other than the Corporation, who is the holder of shares or subordinated debt of the federal member institution, and any secured creditor or assignee or successor in interest of such person, from exercising any voting or other rights attached to the shares or subordinated debt or arising from the holder’s status as such in any manner that would or might tend to defeat or interfere with the rights, powers, privileges and immunities of the Corporation as receiver.

###### Receiver order dealings

(5) Where an order is made under paragraph (1)(_b_),

  * (_a_) the Corporation, as receiver, may exercise its powers, rights, privileges and immunities without leave, approval or other intervention of a court, but may seek the assistance of a superior court in order to give effect to those powers, rights, privileges and immunities,

including any interest accrued or payable to that person.

###### Included moneys

(1.1) For greater certainty, an unpaid balance of moneys received or held by an institution from or on behalf of a mortgagor in respect of realty taxes on mortgaged property is a deposit.

###### Excluding moneys

(2) The following moneys are excluded from the moneys referred to in subsection (1):

  * (_a_) moneys received or held by the institution if the date of deposit is or was on or after April 17, 1967 unless the institution is or was obligated, or may by the demand of that person become obligated, to repay the moneys on or before the expiration of five years after the date of the deposit; and

  * (_b_) moneys held by the institution that were received by it when it was not a federal institution or provincial institution.

###### Where more than one repayment day

(2.1) For the purposes of subsection (2), where an institution is, in respect of deposit moneys received or held by it, obligated to repay the moneys to a person on a fixed day and also is or may become obligated to repay the moneys

  * (_a_) on an earlier date by virtue of a right of withdrawal, reinvestment or other right afforded to the person by the terms under which the moneys were solicited or received or are held, only the fixed day shall be considered, or

  * (_b_) on a later date by virtue of a right afforded to any person to extend the term of the deposit at a rate or rates of interest determined at the time the moneys were solicited or received, the later date is deemed to be the fixed day

in determining whether the institution is or may become obligated to repay the moneys on or before the expiration of five years after the date of the deposit, whether or not the right is exercised.

###### Right to extend

(2.2) For greater certainty, a right referred to in paragraph (2.1)(_b_) does not include a right to renew or reinvest a deposit at a rate or rates of interest prevailing on the date of renewal or reinvestment.

###### Obligation deemed

(3) For the purposes of subsection (1), if a trust company has deposited moneys in its own guaranteed trust fund on behalf of itself as trustee, it shall be deemed to be obligated to repay the moneys to the same extent as it would have been obligated to repay the moneys had the moneys been deposited by a trustee other than itself.

  * (_a_) the moneys do not constitute a deposit unless the instrument and records of the institution specify the person entitled, at the date of issue of the instrument, to the repayment of the moneys evidenced thereby;

  * (_b_) the person referred to in paragraph (_a_) shall be deemed to be the depositor in respect of the moneys unless particulars of a transfer of the instrument are entered in the records of the institution, in which case the most recent transferee shown in the records shall be deemed to be the depositor; and

  * (_c_) the entry of a transfer in the records of a member institution is ineffective for the purposes of paragraph (_b_), if the entry is made subsequent to the termination or cancellation of the policy of deposit insurance of the member institution.

###### Trust arrangements

(4) Where a member institution is obligated to repay to a person any moneys that are received or held by the institution, the amount of the moneys shall be deemed not to constitute part of a deposit for the purposes of deposit insurance with the Corporation if the date on which the person acquires their interest in the moneys is a date subsequent to the date on which the policy of deposit insurance of the institution is terminated or cancelled.
