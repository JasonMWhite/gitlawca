###### Work made in the course of employment

(3) Where the author of a work was in the employment of some other person under a contract of service or apprenticeship and the work was made in the course of his employment by that person, the person by whom the author was employed shall, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, be the first owner of the copyright, but where the work is an article or other contribution to a newspaper, magazine or similar periodical, there shall, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, be deemed to be reserved to the author a right to restrain the publication of the work, otherwise than as part of a newspaper, magazine or similar periodical.

###### Assignments and licences

(4) The owner of the copyright in any work may assign the right, either wholly or partially, and either generally or subject to limitations relating to territory, medium or sector of the market or other limitations relating to the scope of the assignment, and either for the whole term of the copyright or for any other part thereof, and may grant any interest in the right by licence, but no assignment or grant is valid unless it is in writing signed by the owner of the right in respect of which the assignment or grant is made, or by the owner’s duly authorized agent.

  * 1997, c. 24, s. 10;
  * 2012, c. 20, s. 7.

**14.** (1) Where the author of a work is the first owner of the copyright therein, no assignment of the copyright and no grant of any interest therein, made by him, otherwise than by will, after June 4, 1921, is operative to vest in the assignee or grantee any rights with respect to the copyright in the work beyond the expiration of twenty-five years from the death of the author, and the reversionary interest in the copyright expectant on the termination of that period shall, on the death of the author, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, devolve on his legal representatives as part of the estate of the author, and any agreement entered into by the author as to the disposition of such reversionary interest is void.

###### No waiver by assignment

(3) An assignment of copyright in a work does not by that act alone constitute a waiver of any moral rights.

###### Secondary infringement

(2) It is an infringement of copyright for any person to

  * (_a_) sell or rent out,

  * (_b_) distribute to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright,

a copy of a work, sound recording or fixation of a performer’s performance or of a communication signal that the person knows or should have known infringes copyright or would infringe copyright if it had been made in Canada by the person who made it.

###### Clarification

(2.1) For greater certainty, a copy made outside Canada does not infringe copyright under subsection (2) if, had it been made in Canada, it would have been made under a limitation or exception under this Act.

###### Secondary infringement  — exportation

(2.11) It is an infringement of copyright for any person, for the purpose of doing anything referred to in paragraphs (2)(_a_) to (_c_), to export or attempt to export a copy  —  of a work, sound recording or fixation of a performer’s performance or of a communication signal  —  that the person knows or should have known was made without the consent of the owner of the copyright in the country where the copy was made.

###### Exception

(2.12) Subsection (2.11) does not apply with respect to a copy that was made under a limitation or exception under this Act or, if it was made outside Canada, that would have been made under such a limitation or exception had it been made in Canada.

###### Secondary infringement related to lesson

(2.2) It is an infringement of copyright for any person to do any of the following acts with respect to anything that the person knows or should have known is a lesson, as defined in subsection 30.01(1), or a fixation of one:

  * (_b_) to distribute it to an extent that the owner of the copyright in the work or other subject-matter that is included in the lesson is prejudicially affected;

  * (_c_) by way of trade, to distribute it, expose or offer it for sale or rental or exhibit it in public;

  * (_d_) to possess it for the purpose of doing anything referred to in any of paragraphs (_a_) to (_c_);

###### Infringement — provision of services

(2.3) It is an infringement of copyright for a person, by means of the Internet or another digital network, to provide a service primarily for the purpose of enabling acts of copyright infringement if an actual infringement of copyright occurs by means of the Internet or another digital network as a result of the use of that service.

###### Factors

(2.4) In determining whether a person has infringed copyright under subsection (2.3), the court may consider

  * (_a_) whether the person expressly or implicitly marketed or promoted the service as one that could be used to enable acts of copyright infringement;

  * (_b_) whether the person had knowledge that the service was used to enable a significant number of acts of copyright infringement;

  * (_c_) whether the service has significant uses other than to enable acts of copyright infringement;

  * (_d_) the person’s ability, as part of providing the service, to limit acts of copyright infringement, and any action taken by the person to do so;

  * (_e_) any benefits the person received as a result of enabling the acts of copyright infringement; and

  * (_f_) the economic viability of the provision of the service if it were not used to enable acts of copyright infringement.

(3) In determining whether there is an infringement under subsection (2) in the case of an activity referred to in any of paragraphs (2)(_a_) to (_d_) in relation to a copy that was imported in the circumstances referred to in paragraph (2)(_e_), it is irrelevant whether the importer knew or should have known that the importation of the copy infringed copyright.

###### Plates

(4) It is an infringement of copyright for any person to make or possess a plate that has been specifically designed or adapted for the purpose of making infringing copies of a work or other subject-matter.

###### Public performance for profit

(5) It is an infringement of copyright for any person, for profit, to permit a theatre or other place of entertainment to be used for the performance in public of a work or other subject-matter without the consent of the owner of the copyright unless that person was not aware, and had no reasonable ground for suspecting, that the performance would be an infringement of copyright.

###### Secondary infringement

(2) Subject to any regulations made under subsection (6), where the circumstances described in paragraph (1)(_a_) exist, it is an infringement of copyright in an imported book for any person who knew or should have known that the book would infringe copyright if it was made in Canada by the importer to

  * (_a_) sell or rent out the book;

  * (_b_) by way of trade, distribute, expose or offer for sale or rental, or exhibit in public, the book; or
