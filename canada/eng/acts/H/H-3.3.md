###### Recovery of fines

**70.** Where a person is convicted of an offence under this Act and a fine that is imposed as punishment is not paid when required, the prosecutor may, by filing the conviction, enter as a judgment the amount of the fine and costs, if any, in the superior court of the province in which the trial was held, and the judgment is enforceable against the convicted person in the same manner as if it were a judgment obtained by Her Majesty in right of Canada against the person in that court in civil proceedings.

###### Officers, etc., of corporations

**71.** Where a corporation commits an offence under this Act, any officer, director or agent of the corporation who directed, authorized, assented to or acquiesced or participated in the commission of the offence is a party to and guilty of the offence and is liable on conviction to the punishment provided for the offence, whether or not the corporation has been prosecuted or convicted.

###### Offences by employees or agents

**72.** In any prosecution for an offence under this Act, it is sufficient proof of the offence to establish that it was committed by an employee or agent of the accused, whether or not the employee or agent is identified or has been prosecuted for the offence, unless the accused establishes that

  * (_a_) the offence was committed without the knowledge or consent of the accused; and

  * (_b_) the accused exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence.

###### Place of trial

**73.** A prosecution for an offence under this Act may be instituted, heard and determined in the place where

  * (_a_) the offence was committed or the subject-matter of the prosecution arose;

  * (_b_) the accused was apprehended; or

  * (_c_) the accused happens to be, or is carrying on business.
