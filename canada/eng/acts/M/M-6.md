###### Where dependant not a resident of Canada

(2) Where a dependant of any seaman is not a resident of Canada, the dependant is not entitled to compensation under this Act unless, by the law of the place or country in which he resides, the dependants of a seaman to whom an accident happens in that place or country if resident in Canada would be entitled to compensation, and where such dependants would be entitled to compensation under that law, the compensation to which the non-resident dependant is entitled under this Act shall not be greater than the compensation payable in the like case under that law.

###### Where entitled to action against other person

**24.** (1) Where an accident happens to a seaman arising out of and in the course of his employment under such circumstances as entitled him or his dependants to an action against a person other than his co-employees, his employer, the servants or mandataries of his employer, the seaman or his dependants if entitled to compensation under this Act may claim compensation or may bring an action.

###### Where smaller amount collected

(2) Where an action is brought and less is recovered and collected than the amount of the compensation to which a seaman or his dependants are entitled under this Act, the difference between the amount recovered and collected and the amount of the compensation shall be payable as compensation to the seaman or his dependants.

###### Employer subrogated

(3) Where a seaman or his dependants elect to claim compensation under this Act, the employer is subrogated to the rights of the seaman or his dependants and may maintain an action in his or their names or in the name of the employer against the person against whom the action lies.

###### Failure to give notice

(4) Failure to give the prescribed notice or to make the claim referred to in subsection (1), or any defect or inaccuracy in a notice, does not bar the right to compensation if in the opinion of the Board the employer was not prejudiced thereby or it appears that the claim for compensation is a just one and ought to be allowed.

  * R.S., c. M-11, s. 24.

## NOTICE OF ACCIDENT

###### Employer to give notice

  * (_g_) where the dependants are persons other than those mentioned in paragraphs (_d_) to (_f_), a sum reasonable and proportionate to the pecuniary loss to those dependants occasioned by the death, to be determined by the Board.

###### Where no survivor

(2) Where a seaman leaves no survivor or the survivor subsequently dies, and it seems desirable to continue the existing household, and a suitable person acts as foster-parent in keeping up the household and maintaining and taking care of the children entitled to compensation in a manner that the Board deems satisfactory, the foster-parent while so doing is entitled to receive the same monthly payments of compensation as if the foster-parent were the survivor of the deceased, and in that case the children’s part of the payments shall be in lieu of the monthly payments that they would otherwise have been entitled to receive.

###### Additional sum

(3) In addition to any other compensation provided for under this section, the survivor or, where the seaman leaves no survivor, the foster-parent, as described in subsection (2), is entitled to a lump sum of $16,868.50.

###### Duration of payments

(4) In the case provided for by paragraph (1)(_g_), the payments shall continue only so long as, in the opinion of the Board, it might reasonably have been expected that the seaman, had he lived, would have continued to contribute to the support of the dependants, and, in any case under that paragraph, compensation may be made wholly or partly in a lump sum or by such form of payment as the Board in the circumstances deems most suitable.

###### Dependant to whom seaman stood in loco parentis

(7) Where there are both total and partial dependants, the compensation may be allotted partly to the total and partly to the partial dependants.

###### Payments to other persons

(8) Where the Board is of the opinion that for any reason it is considered necessary or desirable that a payment in respect of a child should not be made directly to its parent, the Board may direct that the payment be made to such person or be applied in such manner as the Board may deem most advantageous for the child.

###### Maximum compensation

(9) Exclusive of the expenses of burial of the seaman and the lump sum of eight hundred and thirty-three dollars referred to in subsection (3), the compensation payable as provided by subsection (1) shall not in any case exceed seventy-five per cent of the average earnings of the seaman mentioned in section 36, and if the compensation payable under subsection (1) would in any case exceed that percentage, it shall be reduced accordingly, and where several persons are entitled to monthly payments the payments shall be reduced proportionately, but the minimum compensation shall be

  * (_a_) where the survivor is the sole dependant, a monthly payment of $1,451.92, or if the seaman’s average earnings are less than $1,451.92 per month, the amount of those earnings; and

  * (_b_) where the dependants are a survivor and one or more children, a monthly payment of $1,613.10 for the survivor and one child irrespective of the amount of the seaman’s earnings, with a further monthly payment of $161.18 for each additional child unless the total monthly compensation exceeds the seaman’s average earnings, in which case the compensation shall be a sum equal to those earnings or $1,613.10, whichever is the greater, the share for each child entitled to compensation being reduced proportionately.

  * R.S., c. M-11, s. 33.

###### Permanent partial disability

**37.** (1) Where permanent partial disability of a seaman results from an injury, the impairment of earning capacity of the seaman shall be estimated from the nature and degree of the injury, and the compensation shall be a weekly payment during the lifetime of the seaman in the same proportion to the weekly payment payable under section 36 as the impairment of earning capacity is to total earning capacity.

###### Idem

(2) Where the Board deems it more equitable, the Board may award compensation for permanent partial disability, having regard to the difference between the average weekly earnings of the seaman before the accident and the average amount that he is earning or is able to earn in a suitable employment or business after the accident, and the compensation may be a weekly payment of seventy-five per cent of the difference, and regard shall be had to the seaman’s fitness to continue the employment in which he was injured or to adapt himself to some other suitable occupation.

###### Rating schedule

(3) The Board may compile a rating schedule of percentages of impairment of earning capacity for specified injuries or mutilations that may be used as a guide in determining the compensation payable in permanent partial disability cases.

###### Fixed amount

(4) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2), where the impairment of earning capacity of the seaman does not exceed ten per cent of his earning capacity, instead of a weekly payment payable under those subsections, the Board may, unless the Board is of the opinion that it would not be to the advantage of the seaman to do so, fix an amount to be paid to the seaman as full compensation therefor and pay him the amount either in one sum or in periodic payments as the Board may direct.

  * R.S., c. M-11, s. 34.

###### In case of shortness of employment

(2) Where, owing to the shortness of the time during which a seaman was in the employment of his employer or the casual nature of his employment or the terms thereof, it is impracticable to compute the rate of remuneration as of the date of an accident, regard may be had to the average weekly or monthly amount that, during the twelve months previous to the accident, was being earned by a person in the same grade employed at the same work by the same employer, or if there is no person so employed, then by a person in the same grade employed in the same class of employment on a ship of the same class.

###### Diversion of compensation from survivor

(2) If the survivor of a seaman is entitled to compensation under section 31 and it is made to appear to the Board that the seaman’s spouse, former spouse, former common-law partner or children under 18 years of age are without adequate means of support, the Board may divert the compensation in whole or in part from the survivor for their benefit.

###### Meaning of "common-law partner"

(3) In this section, “common-law partner” means a person who is cohabiting with a seaman in a conjugal relationship, having so cohabited for a period of at least one year, or who had been so cohabiting for a period of at least one year at the time of the seaman’s death.
