(1.2) The supplement shall not exceed the product obtained by multiplying the amount not paid by the rate of interest prescribed for the purpose of section 155.1 of the [Financial Administration Act](/canada/eng/acts/F/F-11.md), calculated over the period that, in the opinion of the Minister, the payment has been delayed.

## CALCULATION OF PAYMENTS

###### Payments in lieu of real property tax

**4.** (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) and 5(1) and (2), a payment referred to in paragraph 3(1)(_a_) shall not exceed the product of

  * (_a_) the effective rate in the taxation year applicable to the federal property in respect of which the payment may be made, and

  * (_b_) for taxpayers of different religious denominations and for different classes of taxable property,

there shall be substituted for the effective rate referred to in paragraph (1)(_a_) a rate equal to the rate calculated in accordance with subsection (3).

###### Calculation of rate to be substituted

(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the rate substituted for the effective rate referred to in paragraph (1)(_a_) shall be a rate equal to the aggregate of that part of the effective rate in the taxation year that is used in determining the amount of the real property tax that is levied for purposes other than school purposes, and

  * (_a_) if paragraph (2)(_a_) applies, a rate for school purposes determined by dividing

    * (i) the portion of the real property tax levied for school purposes by the taxing authority in the taxation year,

by

  * (_b_) if paragraph (2)(_b_) applies, a rate for school purposes for each class of taxable property determined by dividing

    * (i) the portion of the real property tax levied for school purposes by the taxing authority in respect of property of that class in the taxation year,

the Minister may, in determining the amount of any payment to that taxing authority, make an adjustment in the effective rate or in any portion of it so that the payment will not exceed the amount described in subsection (2).

###### The amount over which a grant will not exceed

(2) The amount referred to in subsection (1) is the amount that would have been determined by the Minister if the property value referred to in paragraph (1)(_b_) that is in excess of twenty-five per cent of the total assessed value of the taxable property situated within the area in which the taxing authority referred to in subsection (1) has the power to levy and collect a real property tax, had been taken into account by the taxing authority in establishing the real property tax rate for the taxation year.

###### Presumption

(3) Where one authority collects a real property tax that is established by another authority, the authority that collects the tax shall, for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), be deemed to be the authority that establishes the real property tax rate.

  * 2000, c. 8, s. 8.

###### Payments in lieu of frontage or area tax
