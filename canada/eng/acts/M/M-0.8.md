###### Certificate of designation

(2) The Minister shall furnish every security inspector with a certificate of designation as a security inspector and, on entering any place or inspecting anything, a security inspector shall show the certificate to the person apparently in charge of the place or thing if the person requests proof of the security inspector’s designation.

###### Inspection of vessels and marine facilities

**23.** (1) For the purpose of ensuring compliance with this Act and any regulation, security measure or security rule, a security inspector may at any reasonable time, but subject to subsection (3), board and inspect any vessel or enter and inspect any marine facility if the inspector is designated to inspect the vessel or facility.

###### Powers of inspector

(2) When conducting the inspection, the security inspector may

  * (_a_) require the attendance of and question any person who the inspector considers will be able to assist in the inspection;
