###### Defence

**40.** No person shall be found guilty of an offence if it is established that the person took all reasonable measures to comply with this Act or to prevent the commission of the offence.

## EVIDENCE

###### Certificate or report of inspector

**41.** (1) In any prosecution for an offence, a certificate, report or other document, appearing to have been signed by the Minister or by an inspector, is admissible in evidence without proof of the signature or official character of the person appearing to have signed it and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, is proof of the matters asserted in it.

###### Copies

(2) In any prosecution for an offence, a copy made by an inspector under section 15 and appearing to have been certified under the inspector’s signature as a true copy is admissible in evidence without proof of the signature or official character of the person appearing to have signed it and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, has the same probative force as the original would have if it were proved in the ordinary way.

###### Notice

(3) No certificate, report or copy shall be received in evidence unless the party intending to produce it has, before the trial, served on the party against whom it is intended to be produced reasonable notice of that intention together with a duplicate of the certificate, report or copy.

###### Prima facie proof

**42.** In any prosecution for an offence, evidence that a means of containment or transport bore a dangerous goods mark — or another mark that is likely to be mistaken for a dangerous goods mark — or was accompanied by a shipping record is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof of the presence and identification of dangerous goods indicated by the dangerous goods mark or other mark or the shipping record.
