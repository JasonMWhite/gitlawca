    * (ii) the denominator is the estimated number of persons in Canada, on the first day of that loan year, of the same age group, and

    * (i) the numerator is the estimated number of persons who were enrolled as part-time students for a period of studies in that province in the previous loan year, and

    * (ii) the denominator is the estimated number of persons who were enrolled as part-time students for a period of studies in Canada in the previous loan year.

###### Calculation of loan provision

(3) The basic loan provision for any loan year is an amount, as determined by the Minister after consultation with the Chief Statistician of Canada, equal to the product obtained by multiplying

  * (_a_) five hundred and thirty million dollars

by

  * (_b_) the quotient obtained by dividing the estimated number of persons in Canada that will be enrolled as full-time students in programs of studies at a post-secondary school level in that loan year by the number of persons in Canada that were enrolled as full-time students in programs of studies at a post-secondary school level in the loan year commencing in 1983

###### Calculation of payment

(2) An alternative amount for a province for a loan year beginning before August 1, 1991 is the amount, as determined by the Minister after consultation with the Chief Statistician of Canada, obtained by

    * (i) subject to subsection (3), the aggregate of all amounts paid by the Minister in that loan year to lenders pursuant to sections 6, 7, 8, 12 and 13 and paragraph 10(_b_) and to collection agencies in respect of guaranteed student loans made pursuant to certificates of eligibility issued or caused to be issued by the appropriate authorities for participating provinces that issued or caused to be issued such certificates in that loan year, minus all amounts collected by or on behalf of Her Majesty in that loan year in respect of those loans,

by

    * (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing

      * (A) the estimated number of persons in that province that, on the first day of that loan year, have attained eighteen years of age and have not attained twenty-five years of age,

by

      * (B) the estimated number of persons, in provinces the appropriate authorities for which issued or caused to be issued certificates of eligibility in that loan year, that, on the first day of that loan year, have attained eighteen years of age and have not attained twenty-five years of age; and

    * (i) the net per capita costs for participating provinces for the loan year beginning on August 1, 1990
