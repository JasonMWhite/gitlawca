  * (_b_) that by the law in force in any foreign country provision has been made for the fixing, marking and certifying of load lines on ships, or any class or description of ships, registered in that country and has also been so made, or has been agreed to be so made, for recognizing Load Line Convention Certificates issued in Canada as having the same effect in ports of that country as certificates issued under that provision,

and that the provision for the fixing, marking and certifying of load lines is based on the same principles as the corresponding provisions of this Part and is equally effective, the Governor in Council may direct that Load Line Certificates issued pursuant to that provision in respect of British ships, or that class or description of British ships, registered in that Commonwealth country, or in respect of ships, or that class or description of ships, of that foreign country, as the case may be, have the same effect for the purpose of this Part as Special Load Line Certificates issued in Canada pursuant to this section.

###### Offence and punishment

(7) For any contravention or attempted contravention of this section, the owner or master of any ship is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of not more than twenty-five hundred dollars and not less than one hundred dollars, but in any proceedings against a master in respect of a contravention of the timber cargo regulations, it is a good defence to prove that the contravention was due solely to deviation or delay, the deviation or delay being caused solely by stress of weather or other circumstances that neither the master, the owner nor the charterer, if any, could have prevented or forestalled.

###### Idem

(4) The owner or master of a ship that is loaded so as to submerge the appropriate load line of the ship beyond the limits of submergence for that ship as determined by regulations made under subsection (2) is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars and to an additional fine not exceeding five hundred dollars for each inch or fraction of an inch by which the appropriate load line of the ship is submerged beyond the limits of submergence for that ship.

## CHAPTER III - RIGHTS OF SALVORS

#### **Article 12**  
Conditions for reward

1 Salvage operations which have had a useful result give right to a reward.

2 Except as otherwise provided, no payment is due under this Convention if the salvage operations have had no useful result.

3 This chapter shall apply, notwithstanding that the salved vessel and the vessel undertaking the salvage operations belong to the same owner.

#### **Article 13**  
Criteria for fixing the reward

1 The reward shall be fixed with a view to encouraging salvage operations, taking into account the following criteria without regard to the order in which they are presented below:

  * (a) the salved value of the vessel and other property;

  * (b) the skill and efforts of the salvors in preventing or minimizing damage to the environment;

  * (c) the measure of success obtained by the salvor;

  * (d) the nature and degree of the danger;

  * (e) the skill and efforts of the salvors in salving the vessel, other property and life;

  * (f) the time used and expenses and losses incurred by the salvors;

  * (g) the risk of liability and other risks run by the salvors or their equipment;

  * (h) the promptness of the services rendered;

  * (i) the availability and use of vessels or other equipment intended for salvage operations;

  * (j) the state of readiness and efficiency of the salvor’s equipment and the value thereof.

2 Payment of a reward fixed according to paragraph 1 shall be made by all of the vessel and other property interests in proportion to their respective salved values. However, a State Party may in its national law provide that the payment of a reward has to be made by one of these interests, subject to a right of recourse of this interest against the other interests for their respective shares. Nothing in this article shall prevent any right of defence.

3 The rewards, exclusive of any interest and recoverable legal costs that may be payable thereon, shall not exceed the salved value of the vessel and other property.

#### **Article 14**  
Special compensation

1 If the salvor has carried out salvage operations in respect of a vessel which by itself or its cargo threatened damage to the environment and has failed to earn a reward under article 13 at least equivalent to the special compensation assessable in accordance with this article, he shall be entitled to special compensation from the owner of that vessel equivalent to his expenses as herein defined.

2 If, in the circumstances set out in paragraph 1, the salvor by his salvage operations has prevented or minimized damage to the environment, the special compensation payable by the owner to the salvor under paragraph 1 may be increased up to a maximum of 30% of the expenses incurred by the salvor. However, the tribunal, if it deems it fair and just to do so and bearing in mind the relevant criteria set out in article 13, paragraph 1, may increase such special compensation further, but in no event shall the total increase be more than 100% of the expenses incurred by the salvor.

3 Salvor’s expenses for the purpose of paragraphs 1 and 2 means the out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by the salvor in the salvage operation and a fair rate for equipment and personnel actually and reasonably used in the salvage operation, taking into consideration the criteria set out in article 13, paragraph 1(h), (i) and (j).

4 The total special compensation under this article shall be paid only if and to the extent that such compensation is greater than any reward recoverable by the salvor under article 13.

5 If the salvor has been negligent and has thereby failed to prevent or minimize damage to the environment, he may be deprived of the whole or part of any special compensation due under this article.

6 Nothing in this article shall affect any right of recourse on the part of the owner of the vessel.

#### **Article 15**  
Apportionment between salvors

1 The apportionment of a reward under article 13 between salvors shall be made on the basis of the criteria contained in that article.

2 The apportionment between the owner, master and other persons in the service of each sailing vessel shall be determined by the law of the flag of that vessel. If the salvage has not been carried out from a vessel, the apportionment shall be determined by the law governing the contract between the salvor and his servants.

#### **Article 16**  
Salvage of persons

1 No remuneration is due from persons whose lives are saved, but nothing in this article shall affect the provisions of national law on this subject.

2 A salvor of human life, who has taken part in the services rendered on the occasion of the accident giving rise to salvage, is entitled to a fair share of the payment awarded to the salvor for salving the vessel or other property or preventing or minimizing damage to the environment.

#### **Article 17**  
Services rendered under existing contracts

#### **Article 18**  
The effect of salvor’s misconduct

A salvor may be deprived of the whole or part of the payment due under this Convention to the extent that salvage operations have become necessary or more difficult because of fault or neglect on his part or if the salvor has been guilty of fraud or other dishonest conduct.

#### **Article 19**  
Prohibition of salvage operations

Services rendered notwithstanding the express and reasonable prohibition of the owner or master of the vessel or the owner of any other property in danger which is not and has not been on board the vessel shall not give rise to payment under this Convention.

## CHAPTER IV - CLAIMS AND ACTIONS

#### **Article 20**  
Maritime lien

1 Nothing in this Convention shall affect the salvor’s maritime lien under any international convention or national law.

2 The salvor may not enforce his maritime lien when satisfactory security for his claim, including interest and costs, has been duly tendered or provided.

#### **Article 21**  
Duty to provide security

1 Upon the request of the salvor a person liable for payment due under this Convention shall provide satisfactory security for the claim, including interest and costs of the salvor.

3 The salved vessel and other property shall not, without the consent of the salvor, be removed from the port or place at which they first arrive after the completion of the salvage operations until satisfactory security has been put up for the salvor’s claim against the relevant vessel or property.

#### **Article 22**  
Interim payment

1 The tribunal having jurisdiction over the claim of the salvor may, by interim decision, order that the salvor shall be paid on account such amount as seems fair and just, and on such terms including terms as to security where appropriate, as may be fair and just according to the circumstances of the case.

2 In the event of an interim payment under this article the security provided under article 21 shall be reduced accordingly.

2 The person against whom a claim is made may at any time during the running of the limitation period extend that period by a declaration to the claimant. This period may in the like manner be further extended.

Interest

The right of the salvor to interest on any payment due under this Convention shall be determined according to the law of the State in which the tribunal seized of the case is situated.

#### **Article 25**  
State-owned cargoes

Unless the State owner consents, no provision of this Convention shall be used as a basis for the seizure, arrest or detention by any legal process of, nor for any proceedings _in rem_ against, non-commercial cargoes owned by a State and entitled, at the time of the salvage operations, to sovereign immunity under generally recognized principles of international law.

#### **Article 26**  
Humanitarian cargoes

No provision of this Convention shall be used as a basis for the seizure, arrest or detention of humanitarian cargoes donated by a State, if such State has agreed to pay for salvage services rendered in respect of such humanitarian cargoes.

3\. Salvor shall mean any person rendering services in direct connexion with salvage operations. Salvage operations shall also include operations referred to in Article 2, paragraph 1(d), (e) and (f).

4\. If any claims set out in Article 2 are made against any person for whose act, neglect or default the shipowner or salvor is responsible, such person shall be entitled to avail himself of the limitation of liability provided for in this Convention.

5\. In this Convention the liability of a shipowner shall include liability in an action brought against the vessel herself.

6\. An insurer of liability for claims subject to limitation in accordance with the rules of this Convention shall be entitled to the benefits of this Convention to the same extent as the assured himself.

7\. The act of invoking limitation of liability shall not constitute an admission of liability.

#### Article 2  
Claims subject to limitation

1\. Subject to Articles 3 and 4 the following claims, whatever the basis of liability may be, shall be subject to limitation of liability:

  * (a) claims in respect of loss of life or personal injury or loss of or damage to property (including damage to harbour works, basins and waterways and aids to navigation), occurring on board or in direct connexion with the operation of the ship or with salvage operations, and consequential loss resulting therefrom;

  * (b) claims in respect of loss resulting from delay in the carriage by sea of cargo, passengers or their luggage;

  * (c) claims in respect of other loss resulting from infringement of rights other than contractual rights, occurring in direct connexion with the operation of the ship or salvage operations;

2\. Claims set out in paragraph 1 shall be subject to limitation of liability even if brought by way of recourse or for indemnity under a contract or otherwise. However, claims set out under paragraph 1(d), (e) and (f) shall not be subject to limitation of liability to the extent that they relate to remuneration under a contract with the person liable.

#### Article 3  
Claims excepted from limitation

The rules of this Convention shall not apply to:

  * (a) claims for salvage, including, if applicable, any claim for special compensation under article 14 of the International Convention on Salvage 1989, as amended, or contribution in general average;

  * (e) claims by servants of the shipowner or salvor whose duties are connected with the ship or the salvage operations, including claims of their heirs, dependants or other persons entitled to make such claims, if under the law governing the contract of service between the shipowner or salvor and such servants the shipowner or salvor is not entitled to limit his liability in respect of such claims, or if he is by such law only permitted to limit his liability to an amount greater than that provided for in Article 6.

#### Article 4  
Conduct barring limitation

#### Article 5  
Counterclaims

Where a person entitled to limitation of liability under the rules of this Convention has a claim against the claimant arising out of the same occurrence, their respective claims shall be set off against each other and the provisions of this Convention shall only apply to the balance, if any.

### CHAPTER II. LIMITS OF LIABILITY

#### Article 6  
The general limits

1\. The limits of liability for claims other than those mentioned in article 7, arising on any distinct occasion, shall be calculated as follows:

  * (a) in respect of claims for loss of life or personal injury,

    * (i) 2 million Units of Account for a ship with a tonnage not exceeding 2,000 tons,

    * (ii) for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, the following amount in addition to that mentioned in (i):

for each ton from 2,001 to 30,000 tons, 800 Units of Account;

for each ton from 30,001 to 70,000 tons, 600 Units of Account; and

for each ton in excess of 70,000 tons, 400 Units of Account,

  * (b) in respect of any other claims,

    * (i) 1 million Units of Account for a ship with a tonnage not exceeding 2,000 tons,

    * (ii) for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, the following amount in addition to that mentioned in (i):

for each ton from 2,001 to 30,000 tons, 400 Units of Account;

for each ton from 30,001 to 70,000 tons, 300 Units of Account; and

for each ton in excess of 70,000 tons, 200 Units of Account.

2\. Where the amount calculated in accordance with paragraph 1(a) is insufficient to pay the claims mentioned therein in full, the amount calculated in accordance with paragraph 1(b) shall be available for payment of the unpaid balance of claims under paragraph 1(a) and such unpaid balance shall rank rateably with claims mentioned under paragraph 1(b).

3\. However, without prejudice to the right of claims for loss of life or personal injury according to paragraph 2, a State Party may provide in its national law that claims in respect of damage to harbour works, basins and waterways and aids to navigation shall have such priority over other claims under paragraph 1(b) as is provided by that law.

4\. The limits of liability for any salvor not operating from any ship or for any salvor operating solely on the ship to, or in respect of which he is rendering salvage services, shall be calculated according to a tonnage of 1,500 tons.

5\. For the purpose of this Convention the ship’s tonnage shall be the gross tonnage calculated in accordance with the tonnage measurement rules contained in Annex I of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969.

#### Article 7  
The limit for passenger claims

1\. In respect of claims arising on any distinct occasion for loss of life or personal injury to passengers of a ship, the limit of liability of the shipowner thereof shall be an amount of 175,000 Units of Account multiplied by the number of passengers which the ship is authorized to carry according to the ship’s certificate.

2\. For the purpose of this Article “claims for loss of life or personal injury to passengers of a ship” shall mean any such claims brought by or on behalf of any person carried in that ship:

  * (a) under a contract of passenger carriage, or

  * (b) who, with the consent of the carrier, is accompanying a vehicle or live animals which are covered by a contract for the carriage of goods.

#### Article 8  
Unit of Account

1\. The Unit of Account referred to in Articles 6 and 7 is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in Articles 6 and 7 shall be converted into the national currency of the State in which limitation is sought, according to the value of that currency at the date the limitation fund shall have been constituted, payment is made, or security is given which under the law of that State is equivalent to such payment. The value of a national currency in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect at the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State Party.

2\. Nevertheless, those States which are not members of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 1 may, at the time of signature without reservation as to ratification, acceptance or approval or at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession or at any time thereafter, declare that the limits of liability provided for in this Convention to be applied in their territories shall be fixed as follows:

  * (a) in respect of article 6, paragraph 1(a) at an amount of:

    * (i) 30 million monetary units for a ship with a tonnage not exceeding 2,000 tons;

    * (ii) for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, the following amount in addition to that mentioned in (i):

for each ton from 2,001 to 30,000 tons, 12,000 monetary units;

for each ton from 30,001 to 70,000 tons, 9,000 monetary units; and

for each ton in excess of 70,000 tons, 6,000 monetary units; and

  * (b) in respect of article 6, paragraph 1(b), at an amount of:

    * (i) 15 million monetary units for a ship with a tonnage not exceeding 2,000 tons;

    * (ii) for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, the following amount in addition to that mentioned in (i):

for each ton from 2,001 to 30,000 tons, 6,000 monetary units;

for each ton from 30,001 to 70,000 tons, 4,500 monetary units; and

for each ton in excess of 70,000 tons, 3,000 monetary units; and

  * (c) in respect of article 7, paragraph 1, at an amount of 2,625,000 monetary units multiplied by the number of passengers which the ship is authorized to carry according to its certificate.

Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 6 apply correspondingly to subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph.

3\. The monetary unit referred to in paragraph 2 corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The conversion of the amounts referred to in paragraph 2 into the national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.

4\. The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 1 and the conversion mentioned in paragraph 3 shall be made in such a manner as to express in the national currency of the State Party as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in Articles 6 and 7 as is expressed there in units of account. States Parties shall communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 1, or the result of the conversion in paragraph 3, as the case may be, at the time of the signature without reservation as to ratification, acceptance or approval, or when depositing an instrument referred to in Article 16 and whenever there is a change in either.

#### Article 9  
Aggregation of claims

1\. The limits of liability determined in accordance with Article 6 shall apply to the aggregate of all claims which arise on any distinct occasion:

  * (a) against the person or persons mentioned in paragraph 2 of Article 1 and any person for whose act, neglect or default he or they are responsible; or

  * (b) against the shipowner of a ship rendering salvage services from that ship and the salvor or salvors operating from such ship and any person for whose act, neglect or default he or they are responsible; or

  * (c) against the salvor or salvors who are not operating from a ship or who are operating solely on the ship to, or in respect of which, the salvage services are rendered and any person for whose act, neglect or default he or they are responsible.

2\. The limits of liability determined in accordance with Article 7 shall apply to the aggregate of all claims subject thereto which may arise on any distinct occasion against the person or persons mentioned in paragraph 2 of Article 1 in respect of the ship referred to in Article 7 and any person for whose act, neglect or default he or they are responsible.

#### Article 10  
Limitation of liability without constitution of a limitation fund

1\. Limitation of liability may be invoked notwithstanding that a limitation fund as mentioned in Article 11 has not been constituted. However, a State Party may provide in its national law that, where an action is brought in its Courts to enforce a claim subject to limitation, a person liable may only invoke the right to limit liability if a limitation fund has been constituted in accordance with the provisions of this Convention or is constituted when the right to limit liability is invoked.

2\. If limitation of liability is invoked without the constitution of a limitation fund, the provisions of Article 12 shall apply correspondingly.

3\. Questions of procedure arising under the rules of this Article shall be decided in accordance with the national law of the State Party in which action is brought.

### CHAPTER III. THE LIMITATION FUND

#### Article 11  
Constitution of the fund

1\. Any person alleged to be liable may constitute a fund with the Court or other competent authority in any State Party in which legal proceedings are instituted in respect of claims subject to limitation. The fund shall be constituted in the sum of such of the amounts set out in Articles 6 and 7 as are applicable to claims for which that person may be liable, together with interest thereon from the date of the occurrence giving rise to the liability until the date of the constitution of the fund. Any fund thus constituted shall be available only for the payment of claims in respect of which limitation of liability can be invoked.

2\. A fund may be constituted, either by depositing the sum, or by producing a guarantee acceptable under the legislation of the State Party where the fund is constituted and considered to be adequate by the Court or other competent authority.

3\. A fund constituted by one of the persons mentioned in paragraph 1(a), (b) or (c) or paragraph 2 of Article 9 or his insurer shall be deemed constituted by all persons mentioned in paragraph 1(a), (b) or (c) or paragraph 2, respectively.

#### Article 12  
Distribution of the fund

1\. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Article 6 and of Article 7, the fund shall be distributed among the claimants in proportion to their established claims against the fund.

2\. If, before the fund is distributed, the person liable, or his insurer, has settled a claim against the fund such person shall, up to the amount he has paid, acquire by subrogation the rights which the person so compensated would have enjoyed under this Convention.

3\. The right of subrogation provided for in paragraph 2 may also be exercised by persons other than those therein mentioned in respect of any amount of compensation which they may have paid, but only to the extent that such subrogation is permitted under the applicable national law.

4\. Where the person liable or any other person establishes that he may be compelled to pay, at a later date, in whole or in part any such amount of compensation with regard to which such person would have enjoyed a right of subrogation pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 had the compensation been paid before the fund was distributed, the Court or other competent authority of the State where the fund has been constituted may order that a sufficient sum shall be provisionally set aside to enable such person at such later date to enforce his claim against the fund.

#### Article 13  
Bar to other actions

1\. Where a limitation fund has been constituted in accordance with Article 11, any person having made a claim against the fund shall be barred from exercising any right in respect of such claim against any other assets of a person by or on behalf of whom the fund has been constituted.

2\. After a limitation fund has been constituted in accordance with Article 11, any ship or other property, belonging to a person on behalf of whom the fund has been constituted, which has been arrested or attached within the jurisdiction of a State Party for a claim which may be raised against the fund, or any security given, may be released by order of the Court or other competent authority of such State. However, such release shall always be ordered if the limitation fund has been constituted:

  * (a) at the port where the occurrence took place, or, if it took place out of port, at the first port of call thereafter; or

  * (b) at the port of disembarkation in respect of claims for loss of life or personal injury; or

  * (c) at the port of discharge in respect of damage to cargo; or

  * (d) in the State where the arrest is made.

3\. The rules of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply only if the claimant may bring a claim against the limitation fund before the Court administering that fund and the fund is actually available and freely transferable in respect of that claim.

#### Article 14  
Governing law

Subject to the provisions of this Chapter the rules relating to the constitution and distribution of a limitation fund, and all rules of procedure in connexion therewith, shall be governed by the law of the State Party in which the fund is constituted.

### CHAPTER IV. SCOPE OF APPLICATION

#### Article 15  


1\. This Convention shall apply whenever any person referred to in Article 1 seeks to limit his liability before the Court of a State Party or seeks to procure the release of a ship or other property or the discharge of any security given within the jurisdiction of any such State. Nevertheless, each State Party may exclude wholly or partially from the application of this Convention any person referred to in Article 1 who at the time when the rules of this Convention are invoked before the Courts of that State does not have his habitual residence in a State Party or does not have his principal place of business in a State Party or any ship in relation to which the right of limitation is invoked or whose release is sought and which does not at the time specified above fly the flag of a State Party.

2\. A State Party may regulate by specific provisions of national law the system of limitation of liability to be applied to vessels which are:

  * (a) according to the law of that State, ships intended for navigation on inland waterways;

  * (b) ships of less than 300 tons.

A State Party which makes use of the option provided for in this paragraph shall inform the depositary of the limits of liability adopted in its national legislation or of the fact that there are none.

3\. A State Party may regulate by specific provisions of national law the system of limitation of liability to be applied to claims arising in cases in which interests of persons who are nationals of other States Parties are in no way involved.

3_bis_. Notwithstanding the limit of liability prescribed in paragraph 1 of Article 7, a State Party may regulate by specific provisions of national law the system of liability to be applied to claims for loss of life or personal injury to passengers of a ship, provided that the limit of liability is not lower than that prescribed in paragraph 1 of Article 7. A State Party which makes use of the option provided for in this paragraph shall inform the Secretary-General of the limits of liability adopted or of the fact that there are none.

4\. The Courts of a State Party shall not apply this Convention to ships constructed for, or adapted to, and engaged in, drilling:

  * (a) when that State has established under its national legislation a higher limit of liability than that otherwise provided for in Article 6; or

  * (b) when that State has become party to an international convention regulating the system of liability in respect of such ships.

In a case to which sub-paragraph (a) applies that State Party shall inform the depositary accordingly.

5\. This Convention shall not apply to:

  * (a) air-cushion vehicles;

  * (b) floating platforms constructed for the purpose of exploring or exploiting the natural resources of the sea-bed or the subsoil thereof.
