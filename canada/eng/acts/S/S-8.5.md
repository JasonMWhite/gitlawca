## SCHEDULE - (Section 2) - CONVENTION ON THE SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES BETWEEN STATES AND NATIONALS OF OTHER STATES

## PREAMBLE

**The Contracting States**

**Considering** the need for international cooperation for economic development, and the role of private international investment therein;

**Bearing in mind** the possibility that from time to time disputes may arise in connection with such investment between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States;

**Recognizing** that while such disputes would usually be subject to national legal processes, international methods of settlement may be appropriate in certain cases;

**Attaching particular importance** to the availability of facilities for international conciliation or arbitration to which Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States may submit such disputes if they so desire;

**Desiring** to establish such facilities under the auspices of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development;

**Recognizing** that mutual consent by the parties to submit such disputes to conciliation or to arbitration through such facilities constitutes a binding agreement which requires in particular that due consideration be given to any recommendation of conciliators, and that any arbitral award be complied with; and

**Declaring** that no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration,

**Have agreed** as follows:
