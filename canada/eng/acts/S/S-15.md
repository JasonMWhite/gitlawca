  * (_d_) if the quantity of goods sold to the importer in Canada is larger than the largest quantity of like goods sold by the exporter for use in the country of export, the sales of like goods shall be those sales of like goods that are in the largest quantity sold by the exporter for such use; and

## Procedure in Dumping and Subsidy Investigations

### Commencement of Investigation

###### Initiation of investigation

**31.** (1) The President shall cause an investigation to be initiated respecting the dumping or subsidizing of any goods and whether there is a reasonable indication that such dumping or subsidizing has caused injury or retardation or is threatening to cause injury, forthwith on the President’s own initiative or, subject to subsection (2), where the President receives a written complaint respecting the dumping or subsidizing of the goods, within thirty days after the date on which written notice is given by or on behalf of the President to the complainant that the complaint is properly documented, if the President is of the opinion that there is evidence

  * (_a_) that the goods have been dumped or subsidized; and

  * (_b_) that discloses a reasonable indication that the dumping or subsidizing has caused injury or retardation or is threatening to cause injury.

###### Standing

(2) No investigation may be initiated under subsection (1) as a result of a complaint unless

  * (_a_) the complaint is supported by domestic producers whose production represents more than fifty per cent of the total production of like goods by those domestic producers who express either support for or opposition to the complaint; and

  * (_b_) the production of the domestic producers who support the complaint represents twenty-five per cent or more of the total production of like goods by the domestic industry.

Meaning of “domestic producers”

(2.1) For the purpose of paragraph (2)(_a_), if a domestic producer is an importer of, or is related to an exporter or importer of, allegedly dumped or subsidized goods, “domestic producers” may, subject to subsection 2(1.1), be interpreted as meaning the rest of those domestic producers.

Meaning of “domestic industry”

(3) In paragraph (2)(_b_), domestic industry means, subject to subsection 2(1.1), the domestic producers as a whole of the like goods except that, if a domestic producer is related to an exporter or importer of allegedly dumped or subsidized goods, or is an importer of such goods, “domestic industry” may be interpreted as meaning the rest of those domestic producers.

###### Producers related to exporters or importers

(4) For the purposes of subsections (2.1) and (3), a domestic producer is related to an exporter or importer if

  * (_a_) the producer either directly or indirectly controls, or is controlled by, the exporter or importer,

  * (_b_) the producer and the exporter or the importer, as the case may be, are directly or indirectly controlled by a third person, or

  * (_c_) the producer and the exporter or the importer, as the case may be, directly or indirectly control a third person,

and there are grounds to believe that the producer behaves differently towards the exporter or importer than does a non-related producer.

###### Where there is deemed to be control

(5) For the purposes of subsection (4), a person is deemed to control another person where the first person is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the other person.

###### Extension of thirty day period

(6) The period of thirty days referred to in subsection (1) is extended to forty-five days where, before the expiration of the thirty days, the President causes written notice to be given to the complainant and to the government of the country of export that the period of thirty days is insufficient to determine whether there is compliance with either or both of the conditions referred to in subsection (2) and subsection 31.1(1).

###### Initiation of investigation

(7) The President may, on receipt of a notice in writing from the Tribunal pursuant to section 46 respecting the dumping or subsidizing of any goods, cause an investigation to be initiated respecting the dumping or subsidizing of any goods described in the notice.

###### Initiation of investigation

(8) Where a reference is made to the Tribunal pursuant to subsection 33(2) and the Tribunal advises that the evidence discloses a reasonable indication that the dumping or subsidizing of the goods that are the subject of the reference has caused injury or retardation or is threatening to cause injury, the President shall initiate an investigation respecting the dumping or subsidizing of the goods forthwith after receipt of the advice.

  * (_a_) in the case of any goods to which the preliminary determination applies, as to whether the dumping or subsidizing of the goods

    * (i) has caused injury or retardation or is threatening to cause injury, or

    * (ii) would have caused injury or retardation except for the fact that provisional duty was imposed in respect of the goods;

  * (_b_) in the case of any dumped goods to which the preliminary determination applies, as to whether

    * (i) either

      * (A) there has occurred a considerable importation of like goods that were dumped, which dumping has caused injury or would have caused injury except for the application of anti-dumping measures, or

      * (B) the importer of the goods was or should have been aware that the exporter was practising dumping and that the dumping would cause injury, and

    * (ii) injury has been caused by reason of the fact that the dumped goods

      * (A) constitute a massive importation into Canada, or

      * (B) form part of a series of importations into Canada, which importations in the aggregate are massive and have occurred within a relatively short period of time,

and it appears necessary to the Tribunal that duty be assessed on the imported goods in order to prevent the recurrence of that injury; and

  * (_c_) in the case of any subsidized goods in respect of which a specification has been made pursuant to clause 41(1)(_a_)(iv)(C) and to which the preliminary determination applies as to whether

    * (i) injury has been caused by reason of the fact that the subsidized goods

      * (A) constitute a massive importation into Canada, or

      * (B) form part of a series of importations into Canada, which importations in the aggregate are massive and have occurred within a relatively short period of time, and

    * (ii) a countervailing duty should be imposed on the subsidized goods in order to prevent the recurrence of that injury.

###### Tribunal to make or resume inquiry

(2) Where the Secretary receives a notice pursuant to paragraph 52(1)(_e_) in respect of goods with respect to which an undertaking or undertakings have been terminated, the Tribunal shall, unless it has already made a finding with respect to the goods, forthwith make or resume its inquiry as to whether the dumping or subsidizing

  * (_a_) has caused injury or retardation or is threatening to cause injury; or

  * (_b_) would have caused, during any period after the undertaking or undertakings, as the case may be, with respect to the goods were accepted, injury, retardation or threat of injury except for that acceptance.

###### Assessment of cumulative effect

(3) In making or resuming its inquiry under subsection (1), the Tribunal shall make an assessment of the cumulative effect of the dumping or subsidizing of goods to which the preliminary determination applies that are imported into Canada from more than one country if the Tribunal is satisfied that

  * (_a_) the margin of dumping or the amount of subsidy in relation to the goods from each of those countries is not insignificant and the volume of the goods from each of those countries is not negligible; and

  * (_b_) an assessment of the cumulative effect would be appropriate taking into account the conditions of competition between goods to which the preliminary determination applies that are imported into Canada from any of those countries and

    * (i) goods to which the preliminary determination applies that are imported into Canada from any other of those countries, or

    * (ii) like goods of domestic producers.

###### Tribunal to be guided by Canada’s obligations

(4) The Tribunal shall, in making a cumulative assessment under subsection (3), take into account the provisions of paragraph 12 of Article 27 of the Subsidies Agreement.

(5) Where subsection 2(1.1) applies in respect of the dumping or subsidizing of goods to which the preliminary determination applies, the Tribunal shall not find that the dumping or subsidizing of those goods has caused injury or retardation or is threatening to cause injury unless
