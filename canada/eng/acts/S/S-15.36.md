# Specific Claims Tribunal Act

S.C. 2008, c. 22

Assented to 2008-06-18

An Act to establish the Specific Claims Tribunal and to make consequential amendments to other Acts

###### Preamble

Recognizing that

it is in the interests of all Canadians that the specific claims of First Nations be addressed;

resolving specific claims will promote reconciliation between First Nations and the Crown and the development and self-sufficiency of First Nations;

there is a need to establish an independent tribunal that can resolve specific claims and is designed to respond to the distinctive task of adjudicating such claims in accordance with law and in a just and timely manner;

the right of First Nations to choose and have access to a specific claims tribunal will create conditions that are appropriate for resolving valid claims through negotiations;

the Assembly of First Nations and the Government of Canada have worked together on a legislative proposal from the Government of Canada culminating in the introduction of this Act;

Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:

###### Unlawful disposition of partial interest

(2) If compensation is awarded under this Act for the unlawful disposition of a partial interest or right of a claimant in or to reserve land, then the persons who, if the disposition had been lawful, would have had the partial interest or right in or to the land are deemed to have had that interest or right.

###### Notice to others

**22.** (1) If the Tribunal’s decision of an issue in relation to a specific claim might, in its opinion, significantly affect the interests of a province, First Nation or person, the Tribunal shall so notify them.
