(2) On production to the Federal Court, a certificate in respect of a debtor shall be registered in the Court and when so registered has the same effect, and all proceedings may be taken on the certificate, as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court against the debtor for a debt in the amount certified plus interest on the amount as provided under this Act to the day of payment and, for the purposes of those proceedings, the certificate is deemed to be a judgment of the Court against the debtor for a debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada and enforceable as such.

###### Costs

(3) All reasonable costs and charges paid or incurred for the registration in the Federal Court of a certificate or in respect of any proceedings taken to collect the amount certified are recoverable in the same manner as if they had been included in the amount certified in the certificate when it was registered.

  * (_a_) a judgment of the superior court of the province against a person for a debt owing by the person, or

  * (_b_) an amount payable or required to be remitted by a person in the province in respect of a debt owing to Her Majesty in right of the province

(5) If a memorial has been filed, registered or otherwise recorded under subsection (4),

  * (_a_) a charge, lien or priority is created on, or a binding interest is created in, property in the province, or any interest in such property, held by the debtor, or

  * (_b_) such property or interest in the property is otherwise bound,

in the same manner and to the same extent as if the memorial were a document evidencing a judgment referred to in paragraph (4)(_a_) or an amount referred to in paragraph (4)(_b_), and the charge, lien, priority or binding interest created is subordinate to any charge, lien, priority or binding interest in respect of which all steps necessary to make it effective against other creditors were taken before the time the memorial was filed, registered or otherwise recorded.

###### Proceedings in respect of memorial

(6) If a memorial is filed, registered or otherwise recorded in a province under subsection (4), proceedings may be taken in the province in respect of the memorial, including proceedings

in the same manner and to the same extent as if the memorial were a document evidencing a judgment referred to in paragraph (4)(_a_) or an amount referred to in paragraph (4)(_b_), except that, if in any such proceeding or as a condition precedent to any such proceeding, any order, consent or ruling is required under the law of the province to be made or given by the superior court of the province or by a judge or official of the court, a similar order, consent or ruling may be made or given by the Federal Court or by a judge or official of the Federal Court and, when so made or given, has the same effect for the purposes of the proceeding as if it were made or given by the superior court of the province or by a judge or official of the court.

###### Presentation of documents

(7) If

  * (_a_) a memorial is presented for filing, registration or other recording under subsection (4), or a document relating to the memorial is presented for filing, registration or other recording for the purpose of any proceeding described in subsection (6), to any official of a property registry system of a province, or

the memorial or document shall be accepted for filing, registration or other recording or the access shall be granted, as the case may be, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the memorial or document relating to the memorial were a document evidencing a judgment referred to in paragraph (4)(_a_) or an amount referred to in paragraph (4)(_b_) for the purpose of a similar proceeding, except that, if the memorial or document is issued by the Federal Court or signed or certified by a judge or official of the Court, any affidavit, declaration or other evidence required under the law of the province to be provided with or to accompany the memorial or document in the proceedings is deemed to have been provided with or to have accompanied the memorial or document as so required.

###### Completion of notices, etc.

(9) If information required to be set out by any sheriff or other person in a minute, notice or document required to be completed for any purpose cannot, because of subsection (8), be so set out without the written consent of the Minister, the sheriff or other person shall complete the minute, notice or document to the extent possible without that information and, when that consent of the Minister is given, a further minute, notice or document setting out all the information shall be completed for the same purpose, and the sheriff or other person, having complied with this subsection, is deemed to have complied with the Act, regulation or rule requiring the information to be set out in the minute, notice or document.

###### Application for an order

(10) A sheriff or other person who is unable, because of subsection (8) or (9), to comply with any law or rule of court is bound by any order made by a judge of the Federal Court, on an ex parte application by the Minister, for the purpose of giving effect to the proceeding, charge, lien, priority or binding interest.

  * (_a_) to be a claim that is secured by a security and that, subject to subsection 87(2) of that Act, ranks as a secured claim under that Act; and

  * (_b_) to also be a claim referred to in paragraph 86(2)(_a_) of that Act.

###### Details in certificates and memorials

(12) Despite any other law of Canada or law of the legislature of a province, in any certificate in respect of a debtor, any memorial evidencing a certificate or any writ or document issued for the purpose of collecting an amount certified, it is sufficient for all purposes

  * (_a_) to set out, as the amount payable by the debtor, the total of amounts payable by the debtor without setting out the separate amounts making up that total; and

  * (_b_) to refer to the rate of interest to be charged on the separate amounts making up the amount payable in general terms as interest at the specified rate applicable from time to time on amounts payable to the Receiver General, without indicating the specific rates of interest to be charged on each of the separate amounts or to be charged for any period.

###### Garnishment

  * (_b_) a person, other than an institution, will loan or advance money to, or make a payment on behalf of, a debtor who the Minister knows or suspects

    * (i) is employed by, or is engaged in providing services or property to, that person or was or will be, within 90 days, so employed or engaged, or

the Minister may, by notice in writing, require the institution or person, as the case may be, to pay in whole or in part to the Receiver General on account of the debtor’s liability under this Act the money that would otherwise be so loaned, advanced or paid.

###### Effect of receipt

(3) A receipt issued by the Minister for money paid as required under this section is a good and sufficient discharge of the original liability to the extent of the payment.

###### Effect of requirement

(4) If the Minister has, under this section, required a person to pay to the Receiver General on account of the liability under this Act of a debtor money otherwise payable by the person to the debtor as interest, rent, remuneration, a dividend, an annuity or other periodic payment, the requirement applies to all such payments to be made by the person to the debtor until the liability under this Act is satisfied, and operates to require payments to the Receiver General out of each such payment of any amount that is stipulated by the Minister in a notice in writing.

###### Recovery by deduction or set-off

**90.** If a person is indebted to Her Majesty in right of Canada under this Act, the Minister may require the retention by way of deduction or set-off of any amount that the Minister may specify out of any amount that may be or become payable to that person by Her Majesty in right of Canada.

  * (_b_) an individual who was under eighteen years of age, or

  * (_c_) another person with whom the transferor was not dealing at arm’s length,

the transferee and transferor are jointly and severally or solidarily liable to pay under this Act an amount equal to the lesser of

  * (_d_) the amount determined by the formula

A - B

where

A 
    is the amount, if any, by which the fair market value of the property at that time exceeds the fair market value at that time of the consideration given by the transferee for the transfer of the property, and
B 
    is the amount, if any, by which the amount assessed the transferee under subsection 160(2) of the [Income Tax Act](/canada/eng/acts/I/I-3.3.md) in respect of the property exceeds the amount paid by the transferor in respect of the amount so assessed, and

  * (_e_) the total of all amounts each of which is

  * (_a_) a payment by the transferee on account of the transferee’s liability shall, to the extent of the payment, discharge the joint liability; and

  * (_b_) a payment by the transferor on account of the transferor’s liability only discharges the transferee’s liability to the extent that the payment operates to reduce the transferor’s liability to an amount less than the amount in respect of which the transferee was, by subsection (1), made jointly and severally or solidarily liable.

###### Transfers to spouse or common-law partner

(5) Despite subsection (1), if at any time an individual transfers property to the individual’s spouse or common-law partner under a decree, order or judgment of a competent tribunal or under a written separation agreement and, at that time, the individual and the individual’s spouse or common-law partner were separated and living apart as a result of the breakdown of their marriage or common-law partnership (as defined in subsection 248(1) of the [Income Tax Act](/canada/eng/acts/I/I-3.3.md)), for the purposes of paragraph (1)(_d_), the fair market value at that time of the property so transferred is deemed to be nil.
