###### Guaranteed minimum income for pensioners

(5) Despite subsection (2), the amount of the supplement that may be paid to a pensioner for any month after December 1997 is the amount determined by the formula

[(A - B) × C] - D/2

where

A 
    is the aggregate of

  * (_a_) the maximum amount of the supplement that, but for this subsection, might have been paid to the pensioner for that month, and

  * (_b_) the amount of the full monthly pension;

B 
    is the pensioner’s monthly pension;
C 
    is the pensioner’s special qualifying factor for the month; and
D 
    is the pensioner’s monthly base income rounded, where it is not a multiple of two dollars, to the next lower multiple of two dollars.

###### Enhancement of supplement for certain married pensioners

(5.1) Where the aggregate of the pensions and supplements payable for a month to two pensioners each of whom is the other’s spouse or common-law partner is less than the aggregate of the pension and supplement that would be payable for that month to one of them if the other were not a pensioner, the Minister may, notwithstanding subsection (2), pay to one of them for that month

  * (_a_) the amount of supplement that would be payable for that month to that pensioner, if the other were not a pensioner,

minus

  * (_b_) the aggregate of the pension and supplement payable for that month to the other.

  * (_b_) in the case of an applicant who, on the day immediately before the current payment period, was the spouse or common-law partner of a person to whom no pension may be paid for any month in the current payment period, the amount determined by the formula

A/24 - B/2

where

A 
    is the aggregate of the incomes of the applicant and the spouse or common-law partner for the base calendar year, and
B 
    is the product
    * (i) obtained by multiplying the amount of the full monthly pension that might have been paid to a pensioner for any month by the applicant’s special qualifying factor for the month, and

    * (ii) rounded, where that product is not a multiple of four dollars, to the next higher multiple of four dollars; and
