  * (_a_) to supervise pension plans in order to determine whether they meet the minimum funding requirements and are complying with the other requirements of the [Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985](/canada/eng/acts/P/P-7.01.md) and its regulations and supervisory requirements under that legislation;

  * (_b_) to promptly advise the administrator of a pension plan in the event that the plan is not meeting the minimum funding requirements or is not complying with other requirements of the [Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985](/canada/eng/acts/P/P-7.01.md) or its regulations or supervisory requirements under that legislation and, in such a case, to take, or require the administrator to take, the necessary corrective measures or series of measures to deal with the situation in an expeditious manner; and

###### Factors affecting financial institutions

(4) Notwithstanding that the regulation and supervision of financial institutions by the Office and the Superintendent can reduce the risk that financial institutions will fail, regulation and supervision must be carried out having regard to the fact that boards of directors are responsible for the management of financial institutions, financial institutions carry on business in a competitive environment that necessitates the management of risk and financial institutions can experience financial difficulties that can lead to their failure.
